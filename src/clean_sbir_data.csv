Recent work at QorTek has shown the technology to increase source level and provide larger bandwidth relative to Type III PZT ceramics for specific designs. This enables form factor reductions and/or improved performance as to enable new design space for acoustic systems featuring enhanced target detection capability (potentially critical to quieter enemy submarines detection). It can enable longer operational life of power source limited systems (e.g., expendable sensors), and extend target detection ranges by enabling lower frequency transducer designs. Despite the recent performance, size, and property uniformity demonstrations of QorTek TX101 textured ceramics, key obstacles remain to realizing widescale market acceptance These revolve around production capacity, yield, and price as yet not being comparable to standard, but much lower performance, PZT materials. The issues are rooted in non-standard textured piezoceramic specific processing steps (i.e., template, slurry, wet forming, and BBO) that are not part of a PZT production causing yield issues. This program will focus on addressing these yield issues as to enable textured parts approach the baseline cost of standard piezoceramic parts in use by US Navy."

Recent developments in lead-based textured ceramic with properties between those of conventional PZT ceramics and relaxor single crystals can improve the performance of these systems, but need to be manufactured at high volume and low cost. Most approaches for manufacturing these textured ceramics involve tape casting thin sheets containing a mixture of ceramic powder and binder with embedded template crystals that are cut to size, laminated, fired (to remove the binder) and then thermally post processed to convert the material to a pseudo-single crystal. Even with high levels of automation, the process is laborious since it requires the casting and stacking of hundreds of layers to produce material thick enough to incorporate into transducers with resonances low enough for most Navy applications. MSI Transducers Corp. (MSI�s) innovative solution to reducing the time and cost to manufacture textured ceramic is to use Additive Manufacturing (AM) to form net-shape ceramic preforms (that include templates). These preforms are post processed, using methods in place at MSI, to produce textured ceramic with enhanced properties. In addition, we will replace simple textured ceramic plates or disks with structures that have higher performance, such a 3-3 composites and auxetic structures, to increase output, reduce the amount of textured material used and also decrease the weight of the transducer. Modeling has shown that these shapes can increase the charge coefficient (d33) as much as 3.9 times those of solid ceramic blocks and require 2/3 less material."

Here, we propose to address one of the critical issues still challenging the use of riblets today - the ability to quickly and inexpensively fabricate and apply riblets to aircraft without adversely impacting their performance.� To accomplish this, we will model and demonstrate three separate manufacturing/application processes.� The first process is a roll-to-roll process where material from a first roll is imprinted with riblets that are stored on a second roll.� The roll of riblets is then applied to an aircraft surface in a separate process.� The second process is similar to the first, but instead of storing the imprinted riblets on a second roll, the material is directly applied to the surface.� The third process is a transfer coating process, where the top coating of the surface is directly imprinted with riblets using a transfer film. While developing these processes is important, it is our experience that assuring that the riblets produced have achieved the intended geometry is critical as is testing of the final product to ensure that the desired drag reducing characteristics have been obtained.� We propose to evaluate the manufactured riblets using a confocal microscope/profilometer that can accurately measure the riblet geometry to assess its accuracy and quality.� Similarly, we plan to test the riblets in a Taylor Couette cell as well as on a flat plate in a low-speed wind tunnel to assess the riblets� drag-reduction capability. Demonstrating the riblet fabrication/application, the riblet geometry measurement, and the riblet drag reduction measurement approaches will put us in the position to extend the work to more relevant shapes and conditions similar to those in flight.� This provides a methodical approach to mature the technology for application to commercial, transport, and military aircraft."

The U.S. Navy seeks to develop a ruggedized, quiet, transom-mounted, retractable electric propulsion system for high-speed planing craft - Special Operations Craft � Riverine (SOCR). The proposed Auxiliary Propulsion Unit (APU) will enable a SOCR to maintain the speed and endurance of its diesel propulsion while having electric propulsion capability for low-speed, silent operations. Martin Defense Group (MDG) is a leader in developing cutting-edge solutions in defense and maritime industries. Through research, technology, and partnerships, MDG strives to solve problems that can change the world. Progeny Systems Corporation (Progeny) specializes in developing and producing innovative hardware and software solutions for the Department of Defense (DoD) and other organizations. MDG will team with Progeny to leverage its previously developed and tested Advanced Submarine Control (ASC) scaled, motor drive and hubless Rim Driven Propulsor (RDP) thruster to provide a viable APU solution. The motor drive and RDP thruster has a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of 6, which indicates that a system/subsystem model or prototype has been demonstrated in a relevant environment. MDG will leverage its naval architecture experience to make modifications to Progeny�s thruster design (i.e., propeller blades, aft stationary blades, duct inlet, and duct outlet). Design trade-offs will be made to balance the thruster�s hydrodynamic design (i.e., efficiency, cavitation, swirl recovery) against motor and motor drive performance (i.e., power factor, switching frequency, harmonics, voltage, current, EMI) versus energy storage constraints against APU component integration (i.e., thrusters with deploy/retract mechanisms) beneath the stern platform of the SOCR. A quiet APU solution will enhance the capabilities of a SOCR to successfully perform slow, extremely quiet operations in contested environments. MDG has specialized capabilities for electric propulsion system design, naval architecture, hydrodynamic analysis, and system integration and is uniquely positioned when teamed with Progeny to provide an extremely quiet and rugged APU system for SOCR use. The MDG and Progeny team�s revolutionary APU thruster, with its lightweight, compact, anti-fouling design, can easily provide these core needs observed across multiple industries, and its versatility allows for both retrofit and new construction. The stored energy components of the APU system have some of the highest energy density values available on the market today (147 Wh/L and 107 Wh/kg) which ensures a compact, lightweight system."

Defects such as porosity, inclusions, large-scale voids, and chemical inconsistencies can inhibit the functional performance of a part and reduce confidence in designing parts for AM. While NDE methods exist to identify defects, such as X-ray CT, they are very costly and time consuming. FTL's previous work, Volumetric AM Metadata Engine (VAME), is Air Force-funded analysis software that provides a framework for AM knowledge capture that is adaptable to different metallic AM processes and design pipelines. Building on that code base, the proposed AM4Sight (AM4 refers to AM-targeted Model-based, Multi-resolution, Machine Learning) tool adds novel 3D build-time data aggregation, Machine Learning (ML) defect detection, and probabilistic defect risk mapping to guide the CT operator and test designer, improving the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and successfulness of AM NDE/I. AM4Sight uses FTL�s voxel visualization engine to identify the probability of a defect at every volume sample of the resulting AM part, as well as the severity of the defect in terms of associated failure modes of the part while in service. This provides �foresight� of defect type and location to the NDE/I technician to guide decisions on resolution, integration time, and test setup. This is a significant improvement to current commercial efforts to quantify the effects of defects on additively manufactured components focus on �brute force� testing, with an emphasis on expensive destructive testing to qualify a printed component."

Parts fabricated using metal AM can have their mechanical properties compromised due to the presence of defects. Presently, quality assurance is achieved by X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), which is costly and time-consuming. In-situ monitoring in AM can help in the democratization of AM by offering real-time detection of anomalies. This research aims to develop artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms that use the data generated by the machine sensors in conjunction with inexpensive optical and acoustic sensors to detect defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) in real-time. � The popular EOS-M290 LPBF machine has 20+ in-built sensors such as O2 concentration, chamber temperature, layer time, recoater speed, etc. This machine data in conjunction with optical and acoustic data will be used to develop AI/ML models for real-time issue detection. A high-resolution optical camera will be mounted on the EOS M290 LPBF machine to collect layer-by-layer images. These images will be analyzed by an artificial intelligence (AI) model trained to detect layer anomalies such as spatter, streaking, hopping, part swelling, etc. An acoustic sensor will be deployed to capture airborne sound waves and analyzed to identify features denoting the evolution and presence of defects. AI/ML algorithms will combine or fuse the data from the different sensors to provide higher accuracy of detection. This project will use the underutilized machine data to achieve high special and temporal information of defects. This project will further build on the current capability of Addiguru�s optical camera-based layerwise real-time monitoring technology which detects issues using computer vision and AI. � Data will be generated by printing samples that will be deliberately designed to include various defects. This data will be analyzed and used for training AI/ML models. The training of the AI/ML models requires labeling of data with the ground truth which will be obtained by performing CT scans. CT scans will determine porosity in the parts. Metallographic analysis will be carried out to uncover issues and train the models. � Combining in-situ machine sensor data along with optical and acoustics signals will provide a significant enhancement in the detection of anomalies. The data fusion will be carried out by developing advanced AI/ML algorithms by Addiguru�s AI/ML and software engineering experts. It is proposed that high spatial and temporal resolution obtained by fusing multiple sensor data will enable precise location of defects and thereby, significantly reduce post-build inspection costs. Successful completion of the project will demonstrate the feasibility to develop AI/ML algorithms for multiple sensory data for real-time issue detection in the LPBF process."

The ability for U.S. manufacturers to 3D-print advanced components in-house reduces reliance on traditional subtractive supply chains and bolsters national security readiness. While AM affords unique flexibility in design for manufacturability, its variance in lack of repeatability and reproducibility introduced various defects, including lack of fusion, gas entrapment, powder agglomeration, balling, internal cracks, and thermal stress, that degrades mechanical properties of final parts. The cost associated with performing post process inspection is an economic limiter and its efficacy is limited by material and material geometry, that is solved by in process nondestructive inspection methodologies. Kitware, in collaboration with Sigma Additive Solutions, proposes to bring the latest advances in deep neural network artificial intelligence and signal fusion to optimize and extend PrintRite3D� for the Navy�s unique needs. PrintRite3D is a platform-independent, interactive, in-process quality assurance system that combines inspection, feedback, data collection and critical analysis. Optimizing PrintRite3D defect detection accuracy will improve confidence in and reduce part-rejection false-alarm rates.

VSI proposes TALON, a system for leveraging natural language descriptions of multi-int data, which are semantically rich, extremely flexible, and can be readily generated and processed thanks to recent advances in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. Combined with geo-position and high-value individual (HVI) identifiers, natural language metadata can express a detailed description of virtually any activity or event with its surrounding context. The ability to generate semantically rich natural language-based metadata from multi-modal input source data provides a massive opportunity to leverage higher level reasoning and trend analysis tools originally designed for streams of text. The proposed threat identification system includes a suite of metadata generation algorithms based on state-of-the-art computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing technology designed to extract detailed content descriptions from multimedia source data. Potential threats are identified within the generated metadata stream by the proposed anomalous activity detection system based on deviations from dynamically learned normalcy models. In addition to developing algorithms for automatic metadata generation and threat analysis, significant effort will be devoted to the curation of rich multi-modal datasets and quantitative evaluation metrics. These datasets and evaluation metrics will be leveraged to establish feasibility of the proposed approach and identify key challenges to be addressed in Phase II. VSI and STR are uniquely suited to successfully execute this project thanks to their experience and expertise in computer vision, remote sensing, natural language processing, and data fusion.

Today, existing tools are time-consuming, workforce intensive, and cumbersome to process and distribute in a timely fashion. Fortunately, this is a problem that can be addressed using modern machine learning (ML). Mosaic ATM, Inc. is proposing the development of a software tool called Librarian, that a) accepts, parses, and stores multi-modal data sources; b) annotates the data source metadata; c) employs a collection of transformer-based neural network models that annotate and represent the content of the data as natural language or in an embedding structure that is common across all modes to allow cross-modality search; and d) exposes a user interface (UI) or application programming interface (API) that lets analysts easily query data across modalities. Mosaic's Phase I technical approach will be to first implement a solution using pretrained models to perform their native task or a related task using zero-shot inference. Example pretrained models that could be utilized include BERT-(language), CLIP-(visual-language), GPT-3-(language), and DETR-(visual-language and object detection). Second, Mosaic will enhance the performance of the innovation by incorporating domain-specific data. For language models, Mosaic will explore a self-supervised method called Generative Pseudo-Labeling (GPL). Mosaic will also explore an image model, specifically a technique called SimCLR. The third and final step will be advanced multi-modal inference which will be approached as a causal language modeling (CLM) problem, i.e., text generation. OpenAI GPT-3 is the current state of the art for such models and Mosaic will also explore a more cost-efficient variant of GPT-3, GPT-J or GPT-2 for fine tuning. The three scenarios that Mosaic proposes to utilize for ML algorithm development and model training are: Scenario #1) Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), protection, and defense of a key international maritime port utilized by commercial and military vessels of various nations; Scenario #2) Support of local LEAs conducting security at a high-risk event such as the Boston Marathon; and Scenario #3) Intelligence support of a Carrier Strike Group conducting an international strait transit such as through the Strait of Hormuz. As a means to bring capability to the end users in the most efficient and timely manner, Ultra has agreed to team with Mosaic for Phase II technology development and Phase III commercialization and U.S. Navy implementation. Ultra's Situational Awareness Management System (SAMS) is a proven ISR platform that is perfectly suited to host future Mosaic technology that will solve the Navy's, and perhaps DoD, challenges with respect to intelligence analysis efficiency and performance."

MaXentric�s solution will refine hardware and software requirements for Marine Corps use cases and deliver functional HUD prototypes for next-generation AR HUD systems that can serve both as training aids and operational tools in close air support (CAS) scenarios. MaXentric�s HUD solution will be unobtrusive and mountable on existing Marine Corps helmet Night Vision Goggle (NVG) rails. The solution will be low-cost (< $10,000) with a ruggedized optical or video-see through HUD, small form-factor, low weight, low power, and capable of high-resolution operation. Specifically, we are targeting a field-of-view (FOV) approaching 120 degrees width and 80 degrees height, a blended, high-resolution 60 pixel/degree Field of View (FOV) across the display area, and a refresh frame rate above 90 Hz. Moreover, we intend to explore directly inter-connected HUD�s using wireless networking (meshed) to improve SA for Marines at the tactical edge. The wireless mesh technology could be based on 5G Sidelink and/or MaXentric�s ultra-small formfactor MaXSDR chipset solution (supports type 1 encryption)."

Over time and with exposure to varying environmental conditions, the elastomeric binder material undergoes oxidative degradation leading to embrittlement of the SRP.� Current methods of non-destructive testing (NDT) using ultrasound exist to inspect SRPs for major defects that occur when aged SRPs exhibiting such brittleness experience failures such as, large cracks, fissures, and delamination in normal transportation, storage, and operating situations. However, these methods do not provide a mode of inspection to reliably detect changes in the mechanical integrity of the propellent prior to the point of failure. METSS is proposing an optimized method of ultrasonic NDT to detect and correlate aging with mechanical degradation of SRP materials. Monitoring changes in ultrasonic wave velocity is a well-supported method of detecting aging in SRP. METSS seeks to fill the technology gap by connecting ultrasonic measurements to mechanical degradation and integrating it with a compact, field deployable system focusing on ease of use for a single operator. This will allow for fast, efficient, and accurate field testing of the SRP motors to monitor propellent properties that could lead to mechanical failure or alter the response of the propellant."

In Phase II, we will confirm our tool�s proficiency in reporting propellant state on both aged and baseline motor systems on a variety of propellant formulations of interest to our Navy Sponsors.

In this time, the propellant in solid rocket motors (SRMs) ages, harming the rocket�s performance. The propellant is a highly filled elastomer containing solids, plasticizers, and stabilizers, joined by a polymeric binder. Over many years sitting in storage, aging field conditions change the mechanical properties of the propellant influencing the propellant�s performance. The rockets� propellant must be inspected at intervals to ensure availability of the Navy�s arsenal. Current inspection methods rely on measuring the propellant outside of the rocket, either by disassembly to take a sample, or by maintaining witness samples alongside the rocket. Because of the difficulty of executing this test, a limited number of test articles and selected and coverage of the full stock of rockets is light.

For hypersonic systems, such as missiles, aircraft, or spacecraft, RF cables and connectors must be able to transmit telemetry, targeting, and other signals during flight. Considering the temperatures imposed on the leading edge of a vehicle traveling at hypersonic speeds (>1,800�C), the inner environment of the vessel will equilibrate to temperatures above 1,200�C, leading to material degradation and complete functional failure of commercial RF cables and connectors, regardless of location. Current cable and connector components including the signal carrying conductor, dielectric insulators, electrically conductive grounding, protective jacket, and metal connector housing cannot survive and function at these temperatures because of their material composition. It is the goal of this Phase I program to identify and down select materials for new and innovative RF cables and connectors that can maintain structure and functionality up to 1,500�C over extended flight times. Working with established corporate partners Lockheed Martin, New England Wire Technologies (NEWT), and McAllister Mills, materials will be chosen, supplied, and characterized at NanoSonic for prototyping and eventual inclusion into conventional manufacturing processes. Specific materials that will be investigated include, but are not limited to, ceramic fabrics for dielectric sleeving, steel alloys for conducting and shielding members, as well as 3D-printed steel and ceramic powders. Through an extensive design of experiments, materials that exhibit optimal performance once exposed to temperatures ranging from 1,200�C to 1,500�C will be down selected for prototyping."

To remain competitive, existing systems need to be further matured and adapted towards greater maneuverability, accelerations, and speeds. A well-characterized thermal protection system (TPS) is required to ensure the vehicle can sustain prolonged flights in these hypersonic environments and to protect the underlying system hardware such as the structural components, sensor/seeker systems, navigation guidance and controls (NG&C) hardware, payload, and other electrical and hardware components for the extreme external flow environment. The Navy has identified the need to expand its ability to do real-time system level test and evaluation of hypersonic weapons. The Navy requires a fast-running, high-fidelity software model to interface with the system-level test architecture for modeling the TPS response to the advanced hypersonic aerodynamic environment for Hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) system testing. Recognizing this critical need, CFD Research proposes to provide an enhanced TPS M&S framework, the Hypersonic Environment Analysis Toolkit (HEAT), to demonstrate the desired capability for the Navy . CFD Research will partner with Kratos Southern Research Engineering (KRSE) to develop and execute a material characterization test plan. The Phase I will see verification / validation of the HEAT analysis for relevant materials and adaptation of the existing application programming interface by a relevant software platform or language to the Navy system level test architecture. KRSE will provide a Phase II test plan. In the Phase I Option, KRSE will conduct initial material tests and provide data to CFD Research to validate the testing and modeling approaches. Further, CFD Research will also begin development of boundary layer heat transfer surrogate modeling for further augmentation of HEAT�s execution times. In Phase II, the team will execute the proof-of-concept methodology developed in the Phase I on Navy-provided materials, geometries, and trajectories."

We use historically anchored, fast running local correlations to predict aerodynamic heating.�� The model is currently implemented as MATLAB based tool set which is used to obtain surface heating rates and skin temperatures for hypersonic vehicles. The software calculates three-dimensional stagnation heating rates and temperatures, and two-dimensional stagnation heating rates and temperatures with and without leading-edge sweep. In addition, it calculates lower and upper surface heating rates and temperatures for flat plates, wedges, and cones. Laminar and turbulent heating rates and temperatures can be calculated, with boundary-layer transition controlled as a function of free-stream Reynolds number and free-stream Mach number or a user supplied routine. The code uses time histories of altitude, Mach number, and angle of attack and roll angle along with a MATLAB 1977 standard atmosphere program to obtain the free-stream properties required to make the calculations. To increase accuracy the model is trained using machine learning on �authoritative truth data� such as high-fidelity CFD predictions, stability analysis, and/or wind tunnel measurements. The model may be efficiently used with 0D and 1D reduced order models or can be tightly coupled to FEM solvers. The highly integrated and robust technical approach used in this effort will support the TRL maturation of TPS systems using new/novel materials. A typical scenario involves model and device fabrication, computational modeling, testing and final TRL assessment. The key guiding philosophy in our approach will be to develop a �digital thread/digital twin� which incorporates all the informational knowledge gathered in the design and validation of a TPS into a verifiable mathematical model. These models may then be combined with system level analysis tools to verify the TRL of the proposed vehicle design and to support the final TRL maturation in Phase III.� We will work closely with the US Navy to develop a software plan to port the methodology to existing HIL Software framework. This design plan will include software System Requirements Review, Preliminary Design Review and Critical Design Review. A detailed plan will be developed for gathering the information needed from new material developments to support HIL testing."

This provides a variety of benefits over hard coded firmware commonly found in legacy encryptors. They are all enabled by the key innovation of using virtualization with preapproved NSA elements to provide flexibility while maintaining trust in the system."

SAFE will utilize existing industry connectors to offer plug-and-play capabilities. In Phase I, Intellisense will develop a project plan and schedule towards addressing the challenging process of obtaining NSA approval and identification and development of key enabling technologies and data flow methodologies. Intellisense�s staff is familiar with the process and challenges in producing NSA Type 1 encryption. After the award we will immediately request the for official use only (FOUO) documents from the NSA and start meeting with them. By working with the Navy and NSA, key enabling technologies, as identified in the proposal, will be verified or modified to support changes or clarification in requirements. We will develop data flow diagrams, showing interconnections and locations of all key components in support of ensuring integrity of sensitive information through all stages of data management. In Phase II, specific key components will be identified, purchased, and integrated into two benchtop prototype solutions. The ruggedness of the designed unit will be confirmed through mechanical modeling. Intellisense will develop a TRL-6/-7 prototype and test its data handling, zeroization, and network management. Successful keying of devices is development and sustainment of the necessary security associations across intermittent communications paths, and appropriate fail-secure mechanisms will be demonstrated."

FORS is based on two innovations: (a) novel integration of compact fiber optic Raman spectrometer capable of quantitative measurements of concentrations of stabilizer and plasticizer in the propellant; and (b) novel implementation of the sensor insertion system equipped with video and three-dimensional (3D) scanning sensors supporting visual and automatic position measurement feedback for safe insertion of FORS into the solid rocket motor assemblies. As a result, the FORS system will provide a compact, automatic, and accurate propellant stabilizer sensor and its insertion system that will be used for propellant health assessment of solid rocket motors. In Phase I, Intellisense will demonstrate the feasibility of the FORS system by developing its technical concept and general architecture, designing and fabricating a laboratory-scale prototype, performing a laboratory-scale demonstration of its capability to measure stabilizer and plasticizer concentrations, and demonstrating the functionality of the sensor insertion system. In Phase I Option, we will prepare plans to develop the FORS prototype in Phase II and coordinate with Navy SBIR liaisons on key technical requirements, data to be measured, size of the sensor, size and functionality of the insertion system, application method, power, and data storage/transmission needs. In Phase II, Intellisense will design and develop a working prototype of the FORS system based on the concepts from Phase I. The design will be sized to ensure that the sensor can pass through the throat of the third-stage solid rocket nozzle and fit the confined spaces of the propellant grain geometry.

Although preceramic polymers have low electrical conductivity and poor dielectric properties, the addition of susceptor fillers can enable their volumetric heating. This approach offers uniform volumetric and localized heating and thus better and more uniform mechanical properties of the final products, while at the same time, lowering the cost of CMC manufacturing and reducing processing time, energy consumption and carbon footprint. Volumetric heating can be used to control thermal distribution in composite preforms and prevent cracking or entrapment of gases formed during high temperature reactions.

The development of hypersonic munitions is a critical National Security interest, especially given the current geopolitical situations. As hypersonic vehicles are subjected to intense thermal effects, some thermal barrier systems have enabled working close to the projected operational temperatures. Nonetheless, hypersonic technology has plateaued due to the intrinsic limitations of materials at elevated temperatures, poor aging properties, and limited manufacturability. Providing overmatch capability via a new generation of hypersonic vehicles will thus require new approaches providing a holistic solution to the multiple challenges.

This approach combines the unique high chemical and thermal stability of phthalonitriles with ingenious design and fabrication of composite fibers for enhanced thermal conductivity. From a fabrication standpoint, these polymers are well-known for their processability, whereas additive manufacturing is an unmatched capability for design and commercial transition. In order to extend the aging properties of these composites, chemical additives will be used to provide resistance to other degradation mechanisms, such as UV light.

The surfaces of the hypersonic vehicle are subjected to extremely high temperatures (>1000 �C) and require aerothermal protection systems on top of the lightweight, high-strength structural components necessary for survival. Additionally, at high velocities (>Mach 5), molecular dissociation and ionization of the air near the surface of the hypersonic vehicle may obscure radio frequency (RF) communications. Transmission and reception through the plasma are highly dependent on the electron density and ion species present, as well as the radio transmission frequency. Corvid Technologies, in partnership with New Mexico State University/Physical Science Laboratory (NMSU/PSL), is uniquely suited for modeling, simulating, designing, and testing deployable antennas capable of functioning during hypersonic flight. In Phase I, Corvid and NMSU/PSL will demonstrate the framework for combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD), hydrostructural, thermal, and electromagnetic (EM) simulation tools to accurately characterize the survivability and dynamic RF performance of antenna systems mounted on hypersonic glide vehicles. This approach leverages existing modeling and simulation techniques currently in use at Corvid and NMSU/PSL for the analysis of hypersonic platforms and RF telemetry systems, as well as Corvid�s in-house high performance computing capability. Three unique mechanical design concepts for the antenna system will be investigated to address the Navy�s hypersonic communication and data transmission needs: pole antenna, telescopic pole antenna, and moveable hinge antenna. In each concept, the antenna system is intended to be mounted on the aft plate of the hypersonic vehicle and consists of either multilayer planar patches or wrap-around conformal patch antennas. After antenna deployment and operation, the antenna can either retract or release and each design benefits from using a small amount of internal volume of the hypersonic vehicle for protection from the aerothermal environment when not in use. The final design concept will be downselected based on the results of the electromagnetic and survivability simulations. Corvid and PSL will assess feasibility by analyzing size, weight, and power, antenna performance (gain, bandwidth, beamwidth, etc.), design complexity and likelihood of success, ease of manufacturing, cost, manufacturing time, surface area and volume constraints, mechanical robustness, and aerodynamic performance for each design."

High surface temperatures require advanced materials, such as high-temperature tolerant superalloys, or traditional materials with environmental or thermal barrier coatings. In addition, plasma formed around the vehicle can interfere in certain frequency bands. Adding electronic subsystems to launcher-constraint reentry vehicles will cause challenges due to the low size, weight and power (SWaP) requirements for these components. For this program, the proposing team will develop and deliver compliant deployable antennae, that can operate in and are able to survive the hypersonic environment. In doing so, the team will leverage its long-history and significant experiences in modeling and simulation of the hypersonic environment, developing flight-proven, cutting-edge antenna hardware, and design of minimum SWaP compliant, developable or origami-type deployment mechanisms. Initially, and in Phase I, the concept of operations will be rendered. All potential antenna operational scenarios will be evaluated, including antenna operation for a small period of time, for periodic access, or after glide body separation. After all options are considered, the proposing team will start down-selecting best solutions in consultation with the Navy customer, in order to arrive at preliminary concept design(s) in Phase I base and refined concept design(s) in Phase I option, with the goal to manufacture prototypes in Phase II."

This desire is driven by advances Russia and China have made with their hypersonic weapon systems. Unlike the nuclear capabilities being pursued by these adversaries, DoD seeks to improve targeting accuracy and real-time communications to ensure successful mission outcomes. Therefore, there is great demand to equip US-based hypersonic platforms, such as the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) platform with robust antenna options that survive and operate in extremely hostile mechanical and thermal environments, enabling advanced, mission-critical functionality.� Available space for the integration of antennas on hypersonic vehicles is severely limited due to the extreme heating caused by aerothermal friction and the aft plate of boost-glide vehicles is attractive for the consolidation of various antenna functions. To fully utilize this space, antenna apertures must minimize SWaP and maximize functionality. FIRST RF proposes several potential low-SWaP antenna solutions to enable advanced capabilities on the CPS platform. Specific antenna functions and integration will be worked in concert with the Government. Validation of developed aperture concepts will be prototyped and tested to ensure compatibility with high-speed vehicle environments."

The limited space on the available antenna real estate limits the number of antennas and other mounted capabilities that can be employed. Fortunately, many systems do not require the use of their antenna all the time. Some only need a small period of time during the flight, some only need periodic access, and some only after glide body separation. Hence, deployable, retractable, and releasable antennas present an additional approach for managing the antennas. There is also interest in applications for relatively high gain antennas with patterns directed perpendicular to the vehicle axis. Deployable antennas are a potential solution for enabling perpendicular oriented antennas. Current hypersonic antenna technologies are often engineered for specific flight regions and operate sub-optimally outside these regions. At the conclusion of this effort, IERUS will provide a design space for highly adaptable and modular deployable and/or conformal antennas which can operate in a variety of hypersonic environment conditions ranging from pre-glide to the terminal dive regions. IERUS begins the design process using a rigorous on-body analysis method to ensure that mission requirements are met in the field. The IERUS antenna design process includes full-scale vehicle modeling to assess on-body gain coverage, thus addressing relevant requirements as they become available based on customer feedback. These modeling approaches are combined with rapid prototyping and measurement facilities to achieve rapid design cycle spins reducing program risk."

However, despite recent advances in seismic imaging and tomography this is still very much an open problem and one that can lead the use of large factors of safety and can result in substantial additional project costs and delays as geophysical features may be unexpectedly revealed during later phases of construction. Offshore conditions in ports and shipyards further compound the problem, and very few options exist for practical yet accurate geotechnical site assessment. However, recent advances now offer several ways in which modern machine learning techniques can be applied to provide an advanced seismic imaging and tomography capability, these include:� Recent advances in physics-informed neural network (PINN) 3-D subsurface map generation from seismic geophone data provides an approach that is robust to noise from secondary reflections, and has the potential to overcome many of the traditional of current linearization-based techniques.� The second way that machine learning may be applied to this problem, is in image enhancement. In this way machine learning can be paired with traditional image reconstruction techniques but used in a capacity similar to that of super resolution to provide additional fidelity or robustness to noise is in ways that standard linearization algorithms cannot.� Finally, modern machine learning techniques can be utilized to identify and provide semantic understanding of 3-D volumetric data. For example, identification of void locations and or soil types can be automatically mapped and associated with individual of voxels within a 3-D image representation of the reconstructed soil medium During Phase I, we will assess the feasibility of each of two of the aforementioned techniques, namely tomographic reconstruction and image interpretation (1 and 3, respectively). We�ll perform optimization and automatically assign semantic labeling to identify voids, anomalies and geophysical features to tomographic maps during the Phase I Option. During Phase II, we would propose to also include 3D tomographic image enhancement, however, we would propose to focus on the core challenges (1, 3) during Phase I.�In this proposal, we will briefly present the fundamental equations, architectures, and technical approach that we will propose to undertake to implement them as means of quickly determining the feasibility of the approach. We will also identify areas where additional data or effort may be required, and will look to provide a solid foundation for a successful Phase II effort, where data will be gathered in the field under conditions similar to those required by the Navy and used to calibrate the models developed and trained prior. Validation examples will include localization and dimensions of timber-constructed�relieving�structures, piles, structural details, patterns, and missing�elements."

The hardware prototype will consist of five subsystems, namely, (i) an array configuration, (ii) a multi-channel SDR receiver based on USRP, (iii) an external clock and clock distribution system, (iv) a PC-based multi-channel data acquisition, storage, and processing system, and (v) a power supply system. The software prototype will adopt a cascaded pre/post-correlation signal-processing architecture to enable precise DOA estimation capability under coordinated jamming and spoofing attacks. The pre-correlation jamming detection, estimation, and suppression module performs jamming suppression by projecting the array output onto the jamming nullspace with jamming DOA estimation while preserving the spatial information. The post-correlation spoofing detection, estimation, and tracking module adopts a master-slave configuration for phase coherency with cross-nullspace projection to reduce the effect of correlation between spoofing and authentic signals. An innovative spatial-combining scheme can significantly improve the DOA estimation performance, while maintaining GPS acquisition and tracking under jamming and spoofing conditions. The system design approach addresses shipboard multipath, which can be detrimental to both positioning and angular estimation. It further incorporates a self-calibration procedure for the antenna array. Experimental data will be used in Phase I to develop enabling techniques and validate computational algorithms for Phase II embedded prototyping and demonstration."

Caliola is developing one such GPS alternative for the Navy. Our Satellite Communications [SATCOM] Antenna Pointing for Positioning (SCAPP) solution leverages the pointing vectors produced by the Navy Multiband Terminal while tracking a satellite in geosynchronous (GEO) orbit. A key lesson learned from developing SCAPP is that uncertainty in satellite ephemeris is the dominant error source for positioning from SATCOM signals of opportunity. Proliferated low Earth orbit (pLEO) constellations offer a far more diverse and robust set of signals from which to calculate a PNT solution than GEO constellations. It is much more challenging to mount an anti-satellite attack against an entire constellation spanning hundreds or thousands of satellites. However, three design challenges make a pLEO GPS-denied PNT system more challenging than its GEO-based counterpart: maintaining (1) frequency and (2) time stability of the satellite clocks across a massive constellation, and (3) acquiring and predicting accurate orbits for hundreds or thousands of satellites. In this SBIR, Caliola and Advanced Space will architect and design an alternate PNT system that interfaces with the Navy�s GPS-based PNT Service (GPNTS) system. To address the aforementioned design challenges, our proposed architecture will build on Caliola�s SCAPP solution and on Advanced Space�s experience developing positioning and navigation solutions for cislunar space."

The deployment of large, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations presents an opportunity to maintain PNT in contested GPS environments. Emissions from these waveforms may be used in a non-cooperative Signals of Opportunity (SoOP) approach, whereby a PNT receiver passively receives these signals and deduces navigation information from them. Alternatively, a cooperative approach can be taken, where the receiver has knowledge of the signal structure, transmit time, and emitter state (i.e., position, velocity). These waveforms can be a vital source of PNT to US Navy platforms both by supplementing current PNT to enhance integrity and by maintaining PNT availability in Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) or high interference environments. IS4S proposes to perform a concept study and initial performance assessment of LEO-based SoOP that will enhance Navy PNT availability and integrity. Both non-cooperative and cooperative SoOP will be considered in the study. In the case of cooperative SoOP, IS4S will investigate new waveforms or potential modifications to existing waveforms that will optimize PNT for Navy missions. Tradeoffs of each SoOP, including their impact on receivers/user equipment (i.e., receiver designs and navigation approaches), will be evaluated and used to recommend approaches for moving forward. Finally, IS4S will work with the Government to develop an integration strategy into Navy PNT systems, such as GPS-based Positioning, Navigation and Timing Service (GPNTS)."

The APOBS kit contains 45-meters of line charge, a rocket motor to propel the system over the target, and a drogue chute to ensure straight-line deployment. Currently the launch rod for the APOBS rocket is installed at a fixed angle. During set-up on uneven or hilly terrain, Marines are trained to improvise backpack supports to adjust the angle of the launch rod. This SBIR topic would identify a lightweight engineering design solution and tool to identify and set an optimal launch angle for APOBS rocket motor deployment. The optimal deployment of the APOBS grenades is a straight line. Due to rocket motor thrust, drogue chute loads, impulse drag from the rear backpack assembly, environmental conditions, or some unknown factor during deployment, the system sometimes deploys with a transverse wave along the detonating cord. This transverse wave can result in arc, u-shape or loops forming along the detonation cord. These non-straight geometric arrangements of the APOBS after deployment may result in unexploded grenades as the grenades detonate from the rear and front fuzes to the center connector. The purpose of this SBIR topic is to modify the APOBS system to (1) allow variable launch angles that can be optimized based upon terrain, and (2) resolve the shape instability issues that result in non-linear deployments.� The Phase I technical objectives will include: Design an adjustable angle launch rod mechanism. Determine the root cause of the transverse wave instabilities. Design a tension-stabilizing solution for the transverse wave instability. Demonstrate the feasibility of design changes in terms of function, manufacturability, packaging, and ease of use. Develop detailed plan for Phase II effort."

Specific technical efforts include: Reduce Number of APOBS Misfires/Fratricides TETAC intends to work with Ensign Bickford (Letter of Support included) to conduct live fire evaluations using inert APOB systems and live rockets to gather data.�Upon identification of the suspected issues (most likely parachute deceleration and mismatched rear backpack velocity gradients), TETAC will engineer solutions to mitigate the issues. Initial insight from observing live fire videos is leading us to believe that we need to integrate an energy dampener/mitigation system between the parachute and the line charge. Terminating or designing a disconnect between the rear bridle and the backpack�would also go a long way in mitigating the mismatched velocities present at the rear of the device. Variable Angle Deployment TETAC intends to engineer a variable angle launch attachment that�can be prepositioned (in the safe area) prior to employment. This ensures minimal emplacement time, but also allows the warfighter the ability to adjust the launch angle during emplacement if required. While further information is required to narrow the design requirements, we believe that out�engineering concept as presented (figure in technical volume)�is a good conversation starter to initiate customer discovery for design iterations. It should be noted that angle markings on the system, positive blocks to prevent under/over rotation, and other design features are still required. Other Performance Specification Enhancements Numerous system improvements can also be pursued to enhance the APOBS. Phase I efforts should include in depth discussions with stakeholders to incorporate options such as lighter backpacks, faster deployment methods, versatile emplacement systems, and adaptations of these systems to support soft backpack launch operations. Some areas for consideration are outlined below. a. Reduce time to Emplace Container by including designs for an optional ""rip cord"" latch system (as shown in image).� b.

We have both product development and production services located in Conover, NC. IK will collaborate with North Carolina State University�s Wilson College of Textiles (NCSU), specifically Zeis Textile Extension (ZTE), as a subcontractor, focusing on their extensive knitting laboratory and physical textile and garment testing capabilities. There are only two leading manufacturers of wholegarment seamless knitting machines in the western hemisphere: Shima Seiki Mfg., LTD from Japan and Stoll (by Karl Mayer Group) from Germany. These machines specialize in producing highly technical, functional, and engineered garments. Currently, Innovaknits exclusively has 20+ Stoll machines, while NCSU�s Wilson College of Textiles exclusively has nine Shima Seiki machines. As noted in the RFP, the diversity of the available equipment is key to making a thorough evaluation of current state-of-the-art knitting machinery as it relates to SBIR Topic # N231-002. This partnership would allow a comparative study of seamless versus seamed mesh garments using this current state-of-the-art knitting machinery. IK�s position as an established domestic contract knitwear manufacturer would also contribute a unique perspective regarding feasibility in knitwear for this application. Combined with NCSU�s historic background and expertise in textiles and textile product development research, this study would create a favorable position to take knowledge and research findings ascertained from Phase I into a potential Phase II and beyond. Our team of expert knit programmers, designers, and comfort specialists have had previous experience with baselayers and mesh structures for military combat wear. Combined with the support of the only two major manufacturers of whole garment knitting equipment, this will allow us to be successful and fulfill the Navy�s wearer needs. This investigation will examine the potential impact of seamless knitwear technology for the U.S. Navy. The goal is to determine if it is domestically possible to produce comfortable seamless baselayer knitwear for sailors that would provide: improved fit, better air permeability, enhanced moisture-wicking, reduced seams and chafing, decreased bulk, and potential increased protection (FR and No Melt/No Drip), while also reducing production waste and saving time and money."

Current military baselayers are produced using cut and sew methods that create a long supply chain that require multiple production steps and a significant amount of human labor. This makes ensuring Berry compliance challenging. It is critical for supply chain security for the US to develop a larger textile industry that uses modern textile production methods. With advances in computing and robotics, whole garment knitting equipment is now readily available that produces customizable garments on demand that are more comfortable, more durable, require less labor, and produce less textile waste. However, despite growing use in Asia, there are few US based whole garment knitting businesses. It is therefore critical to develop a larger US-based whole garment knitting industry to improve supply chain security and produce higher quality garments with less textile waste. In this effort, TDA will leverage our team�s expertise in garment design, prototype development, and computer aided simulation to transition from cut and sew baselayers to improved garments made from whole garment knitting."

In addition to supporting transmit requirements, the antenna must interface with emerging advanced ultra-wideband photonic receiver technology that can rapidly process threats within the entire frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum from near DC up to 20 GHz with objectives to reach 80+ GHz. Due to challenging vehicle integration constraints, the antenna must fit within a one cubic foot form factor and withstand seawater submersion.� In response to this need, FIRST RF Corporation proposes a breakthrough multi-port antenna design that provides a broadband, dual-polarized, configuration suitable for receive and transmit applications in a single one cubic foot package. The antenna achieves a gain flatness response consistent with the goals of the system and maintains a wide field of view spanning at least �45� in both azimuth and elevation. This field of view combined with excellent pattern stability enables increased accuracy in angle of arrival (AoA) determination supporting geolocation applications. Moreover, the antenna is tailored to interface with next-generation multi-channel receivers by eliminating the need for beamforming hardware that has previously burdened the Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) as well as the efficiency of the legacy systems."

Both arrays are omni directional� with enhanced response across their entire operating frequency range. Both antenna arrays can handle horizontal, vertical or elliptically polarized waves. The low frequency sensor can handle all HF propagation modes; ground and sky waves including NVIS. Both arrays are designed for operation on ground vehicles and designed to MIL-STD 810H requirements for such systems. Two antenna sets are proposed, one for transmit and the other for receive operations. The receive antennas have built in overload protection to guard against the effect of strong nearby emitters.� The antennas are radio agnostic and can be connected to any set of coherent radios with a standard 50 or 75 Ohms impedance interface. We recommend the use of coherent radios for the DF of modern signals, though nothing stops the high frequency array from being used as a commutated DF system. The low frequency system includes a full RF front-end and can be connected to a set of 3 coherent ADCs if desired. This eliminates the need of radios for that array, reducing system cost. The RF front-end includes a set of programmable notch filters that can be used to eliminate strong interferers. It also supports a programmable gain with a range of 32 dB. The antennas are capable of producing DFs with an accuracy of ~2 degrees RMS. The antennas can also be used for beam forming for enhanced pickup, interferer mitigation or directed transmission."

While the telecommunications industry has increased efforts to sense the presence of federal radar signals and alter permitted commercial operations to avoid interference, the Emerging Mid-Band Radar Spectrum Sharing initiative directs DoD to study the ability to vacate or share spectrum from 3100MHz to 3450MHz. Completely vacating this spectrum would compromise US Marine Corps radar operations. Tools that actively monitor the spectrum in real-time, identify and locate commercial emitters, and work with radar operators to plan and/or automatically deconflict interference through dynamic spectrum sharing is of great interest to the USMC. Toyon will leverage our expertise and ongoing development of our existing Software Defined Radio to meet the needs of the USMC to produce a Dynamic Spectrum Management system.

The store certification process ensures that stores can be safely separated from aircraft in flight and develops a flight envelope of the conditions required for safe separation. Certifying stores requires proper model development and simulation which is then validated through flight testing. Flight testing is the most expensive part of the certification process and is ideally just a validation of simulated store separation events. If the flight test reveals new information or shows that the store is unable to separate safely, the store may need to be redesigned which will add time and expense to the process. Thus an effective software tool that can accurately simulate store separation events is a critical component needed to quickly and affordably certify stores.������� We propose the creation of a software system that uses 6DOF equations-of-motion and data from test and simulation events to quickly simulate, visualize, and assess the safety of store trajectories during separation for fixed wing and possibly rotary wing aircraft. Our approach will focus on creating a high performance, user friendly, cross platform solution that will focus on a matrix and quaternion approach that is able to utilize multithreading and GPU acceleration to provide significant speed increases over traditional approaches. Our approach will include relevant interpolation schemes as well which may include Hermite interpolation, cubic splines, or a moving-average method that can adapt between interpolation and regression depending on the form of the weighting function. �We also propose spending significant time defining the requirements of the system and creating a system design with SysML diagrams. This approach will allow for faster development and a system that is modular, well documented, maintainable, and extensible."

The current 6-DOF store separation used by the NAVAIR�s Store Separation Branch is NAVSEP. As a legacy FORTRAN-based tool, NAVSEP lacks commercial-grade software development, documentation, support, and upkeep, nor can it take full advantage of modern computational capabilities or easily integrate into modern workflows. These limitations on have made it difficult for store separation design teams to keep pace with the advancement in complexity of air-launch weapons systems and aircraft platforms. SpaceWorks proposes to develop a new weapons separation toolset using state-of-the-art computer program methods and software utilities as a replacement to NAVSEP. This toolset will be based in a modern programming language and built from the ground up to take advantage of today�s multithreaded high performance computing architectures, and to be integrated into modern automation environments for batch execution and MDAO design studies. This new toolset will be a commercial-grade software product with thorough documentation, ongoing maintenance, and technical support. It will be cross-platform compatible with modern versions of Windows, Mac OS, and RedHat Linux, and would include a visualization tool built in Unreal Engine 5. To develop this new toolset, SpaceWorks will leverage its company background and expertise in store separation analysis and commercial software development. From 2019-2020, under the X-60A development program, SpaceWorks performed the store separation assessment required by the Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office for certification of the X-60A rocket vehicle carriage and release from the Gulfstream G-III aircraft, including the development of a custom 6-DOF trajectory toolset capable of modeling X-60A�s unique flight profile and handling high-fidelity multibody aerodynamics databases. From 2015-2020, SpaceWorks developed QuickShot under SBIR sponsorship into a fully capable 3-DOF trajectory optimization software suite. SpaceWorks now has over 15 active customers of QuickShot across DOD, NASA, aerospace prime contractors, and commercial space/startup sectors. During the Phase I base activity, SpaceWorks proposes to create proof-of-concept software executables for (1) a 6-DOF equation-of-motion solver demonstrating store dynamics propagation; (2) a miss distance calculator demonstrating two-body geometry proximity calculations based on CAD geometry files; and (3) a visualization tool in Unreal Engine 5 demonstrating integration of CAD geometry files, animation of store separation, and user interface capabilities.

The use of the immersed boundary method enables a high degree of automation and the ability to handle complex geometries. The Euler equation will be solved using a Cartesian adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) method which leads to a fast numerical method. The viscous correction method will be based on the most recent theoretical developments for hypersonic turbulent boundary layers, which will improve accuracy over the current state-of-the-art in design tools. � The significance to the Navy of this flow analysis tool is that a more accurate modeling and simulation methodology during the conceptual design phase will allow for more aggressive designs and will reduce the need for physical testing in the later stages of the development cycle."

These aspects make them incredibly difficult to counter. They fly low and fast making detection difficult and fly unpredictable trajectories making it difficult if even possible to predict its path. As such, the Navy is seeking tools to model the maneuvers of hypersonic weapons. Current tools, such as high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have sufficient accuracy, but require too much computational resources and time for trade studies. Zeroth order models are fast, but lack the necessary fidelity for trajectory prediction. To address this need, Spectral Energies (SE) and its team will develop high-fidelity modeling capabilities (using tools like CREATE AV) coupled with design of experiments, compressive sensing, and reduced-order models to provide accurate aerodynamics forces and control derivatives that will be fed into a 6 degree-of-freedom (6DOF) solver. During Phase I, SE will evaluate existing methods for trajectory determination, develop methodology to improve accuracy and efficiency, select a relevant geometry for validation, and perform an initial proof-of-concept. During Phase II, SE will implement the method into government codes like CREATE-AV, perform trade studies and validate the results with high-fidelity simulation or existing flight data."

However, retrofitting Ethernet and fiber-optic cabling can be prohibitive from perspectives such as cost, weight, space, etc. One alternative is to employ available technology such as STANAG 7221 to transport data at higher rates using existing, ubiquitous MIL-STD-1553 cabling. This alternative is the focus of this SBIR topic. KIHOMAC is particularly well suited to perform this Broadband Real-time Data Bus effort bringing several benefits as follows: (1) We have direct program experience operating STANAG 7221 data transfers in an actual aircraft avionics environment in a past program, (2) We have technical and management personnel who were primary contributors to the past program, (3) We hold STANAG 7221 equipment as GFE on a current program that could potentially be available on a non-interfering, sharing basis for support of early SBIR activities, and (4) Our approach is to investigate both a basic STANAG 7221 implementation and a potentially more efficient data transfer approach similar to IP exchanges relieving the overhead and configuration burden of a rigid scheduling mechanism. Based on review of the SBIR topic description, we interpret the scope of this effort as (1) Create and demonstrate the feasibility of a real-time broad band data bus capable of supporting legacy MIL-STD-1553 and also demonstrate transmission of data at a higher data rate, higher bandwidth traffic on a common data bus. Methods for bridging data and providing link status should be investigated. Issues associated with using STANAG 7221 should be investigated and mitigated. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed under Phase II, and (2) Evaluate currently available STANAG 7221 solutions assessing the feasibility of different approaches to implementing an IP-based approach that coexists with legacy MIL-STD-1553 communications. For Scope area 1, we propose to (1) Create and demonstrate high speed transfers, (2) Define candidate bridging methods and monitoring link status, (3) Identify potential issues and mitigation techniques with the different methods, and (4) Define prototyping plans for Phase II efforts. For Scope area 2, we propose to (1) Assess options to provide an IP-based solution, and (2) Define a solution to coexist with legacy transfers. KIHOMAC identified two approaches for SBIR objectives. One approach uses direct STANAG 7221 implementation including the scheduling overhead. The second approach is to investigate an IP based method to minimize or eliminate scheduling burden and associated configuration impact. The Base Period will accomplish initial assessment and definition for both approaches. The Option Period will include Proof-of-Concept implementation of one or both approaches."

To address this Navy need, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (Intellisense) proposes to develop a new Broadband Real Time IP-Based Architecture for Vehicle Electronics (BRAVE) plug and play module based on the unique adaptation of existing System on Chip (SOC) commercial PHY IP and VITA standards. All BRAVE circuit developments will be supported by Systems Modeling Language (SysML) digital modeling. Specifically, the innovative adaptation of existing VITA and modular open systems architecture (MOSA) standards and SysML modeling tools achieves a plug and play solution without any required user configuration once installed. In Phase I Intellisense will create and demonstrate the feasibility of a real-time broad band data bus capable of supporting legacy MIL-STD-1553 simultaneously supporting STANAG-7221 while also demonstrating transmission of data at a higher data rate with higher bandwidth traffic on a common data bus. Methods for bridging data and providing link status will be investigated. Issues associated with using STANAG 7221 will be investigated, and mitigation plans will be developed. The Phase I effort will include prototype plans to be developed in Phase II.

The spectrum on the physical bus occupied by the MIL-STD-1553 protocol is less than 15 Mhz. MIL-STD-1553 has two major limitations. Firstly, it is limited to 1 megabit per second communication bandwidth. While this was considered quite fast in 1973, greater communication bandwidth is required for current compute centric architectures. Secondly, there is no standardized interface for software to use when communicating via MIL-STD-1553. Most software using the MIL-STD-1553 bus needs to be customized for the specific MIL-STD-1553 implementation in use. In 2016 NATO Standard Agreement (STANAG) 7221 for Broadband, Real-Time Data Bus (BRTDB) was introduced. This standard defines a method for using a MIL-STD-1553 compliant bus to provide up to 100Mbps of additional capacity as a separate, independent binary data transport. Thus, STANAG 7221 fixes one of the major shortcomings of MIL-STD-1553, by providing substantially improved communication bandwidth. The problem with the lack of a standardized interface to the hardware remains though�software utilizing the 7221 bus must be customized to a specific vendor�s implementation.�Thus, there is a need in the industry for a standardized interface to high-speed, high-reliability communication hardware for military communication aboard aircraft and other platforms."

Northstrat will investigate and design a prototype solution that can collect and aggregate sensor data for fast, dynamic, and intuitive analysis. The solution must operate in near real-time, handle high data volumes, and be scalable to include many data types and interfaces. Various machine learning (ML) techniques will be considered to exploit the data and provide desired outcomes to aircrews, mission planning cells, and others. ML approaches can exploit data in different ways, including predictive analysis, feature recognition, or classification. ML methodologies help to take the existing long-loop manual process out of the mission-critical timeframe and replace it with real time ML inferences that provide the relevant tactical information required for the mission. During Phase I, Northstrat will address the following focus areas in order to gain a better understanding of the data exploitation challenges faced by NAVAIR. 1. � �Data Sources & Types 2. � �ML Training data 3. � �Data Access� 4. � �Implementation Environment� 5. � �Machine Learning 6. � �End Users 7. � �Requirements 8. � �Data Infrastructure Northstrat�s user engagement process enables rapid discovery of user needs, relevant use cases, constraints, and challenges. We believe the most valuable systems are designed by integrating end users into the development process. During Phase I, Northstrat will plan interviews with various NAVAIR personnel. These interviews are used to identify the use cases, available sensor data, and the desired outcomes that are of the highest value to NAVAIR users. Different problems require different ML techniques to solve. Phase I efforts will use relevant missions and desired outcomes provided by users to select ML approaches that are appropriate for each case. Descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analysis processes will ensure all possible factors and scenarios inform actionable decision making. Northstrat is well positioned to address the data exploitation challenges faced by NAVAIR.

Both space based and surface level sensors are prone to signal blockage by clouds, which absorb optical and infrared signals characteristic to Hypersonic Glide Vehicles HGVs. Well over 50% of the ocean is subject to cloud cover at a given time, meaning that the majority of deployed surface based EO sensors will face significant challenges in detecting and identifying obscured threat signatures. These obstacles demand any successful tracking system to take a multimodal approach to the detection of HGVs, especially during the glide and terminal phases of flight.� HyperKelp proposes that any effective counter hypersonic EO sensing mesh will incorporate tip-and-cue capabilities from rapidly deployable infrasound and acoustic sensors. By fusing EO signals with acoustic and infrasound signals, signatures of overhead hypersonic threats cannot be masked by cloud cover or changes in velocity. Such signals have been used to study hypersonic craft at large standoff distances since the Apollo missions, but only recently have advancements in edge computing enabled the classification of the source vehicles. HyperKelp�s autonomous sensor platforms will incorporate this technology to host acoustic sensors and novel, non-traditonal signal processing models to act as classifier engines. If successful, these automated classifiers will provide tip-offs for cooperative sensor array technology, including optical sensors further along threat axes. This multimodal approach is resilient to weather conditions, increases preparedness throughout the killchain, and offers redundant and independent sources of information that will strengthen all EO-based detection systems.� This Phase I will deliver a feasibility study of a deep machine learning technique to train Dense Neural Networks (DNN) as acoustic signal source classifiers. Building on HyperKelp�s existing body of work, these DNNs will analyze real time spectrogram feeds to identify acoustic signal structures, like N-wave overpressures, that are consistent with overhead hypersonic vehicles. This work will culminate in a plan to prototype this passive sensor and target classification capability onboard HyperKelp�s autonomous Kelp Smart Buoy (KSBM) platforms during a Phase II. The Phase I Option will integrate and deploy the Phase I products aboard HyperKelp�s existing KSBM system to accelerate the project toward delivery of a mission-ready product by the end of a Phase II."

However, the existing approaches like a common data delivery occur asynchronously and take up available bandwidth for intra-application sharing multiple times. The optimization of shared data from the DL for reuse across BMAs has been limited without a unified data management strategy. For this issue, InfoBeyond advocates UnifiedDL (Secure Metadata-enabled Intelligent Data Integration and Management Lake by AI-powered Graph Canonization and Parallel Processing) for providing a secure and unified data management approach in the backend DL to effectively support microservices across BMAs. UnifiedDL utilizes graph canonization with an attention-based neural learning network for integrating heterogeneous datasets into a unified data model for microservices. Such a unified data model enables common data field search by microservices and further enhances the efficiency of data reuse. UnifiedDL also tackles the effectiveness of the multiple-request-format searches from microservices by developing a parallel-processing runtime-optimized aggregated query approach through the cluster-based multithreading execution. Meanwhile, the proposed multi-zone YANG-specified metadata strategy integrates the ingestion-time access control schema for enhancing data reuse, management, and security/privacy. In such a way, UnifiedDL provides effective data lifecycle management within the DL that minimizes the bandwidth of duplicate data traversing the network backbone."

The storage capacitor in AM-TFT circuit design stores next image frame data and can be completely turned off to create ultimate black level. This is a significant�advantage over legacy passive-matrix LED driver where the LEDs are always on for the display to function properly. Since the EIS is also a spherical display, a trapezoidal tiled approach is proposed to create curved surface. The tiled design also allows for aspherical structure by changing the vertical and horizontal radius. Dome type structure can be achieved by adding tiles to the existing design both vertical and horizontal direction. Glass-based AM-TFT back plane substrate allow much higher precision tile size control over PCB-based back plane. In order to seamlessly connect AM-TFT LED glass tiles, a proprietary through-glass-via (TGV) design will be used to relocate the driver I/O traditionally mounted on the side of the tile to the back of the glass substrate. The TGVs are made conductive to electrically connect the LED pixels and the drivers located on the other�side of the glass substrate. In Phase I, a spherical LED display demo unit will be built as a building block that allows extension to a full 180o/60 o horizontal/vertical FOV. A 940nm infrared LED can be added to the pixel to demonstrate NVG compatibility without interfering the RGB color performance (Phase II). The demo unit consists of 16 trapezoidal glass tiles (approximately 100mm x100mm) with pixel pitch of 1.53mm and a radius of 1.5m. The demo unit forms the building block to create horizontal arc. Multiple of such building blocks will be assembled to demonstrate meeting the FOV in both directions. In Phase II, a full AM-TFT spherical LED display will be built with specification meet or exceed the target specification."

This technology offers the potential to significantly reduce vibratory loads as well as increase efficiency, reduce noise, and enhance flight control, making it particularly attractive for both commercial and military rotorcraft applications. However, the practical implementation of IBC presents significant challenges in terms of effecting a robust, fault-tolerant system that can provide the elevated design assurance levels necessary for widespread adoption.� The proposed solution is the development of a high-integrity, IBC architecture that utilizes a unique trajectory-based control scheme in conjunction within a multi-channel, digital communications network.� This approach minimizes key technical challenges that arise due to rotating frame boundary that partitions the flight control computers (FCCs) from the hub-mounted IBC actuation system.� The technical work to be undertaken within N231-017 is the advancement of a high-integrity, trajectory-based IBC system with a specific focus on development of safety-critical architecture.� To meet these objectives Overair proposes to conduct system safety analysis and�simulate key failure modes to ensure the implementation of a design which can support safe flight and landing in the presence of potential failures. Finally, a practical and reliable hardware platform for the servo controller and actuator motor and the associated software will be developed as well as the associated digital data buses and networking switches in the rotating frame.� These elements acutely comprise key technologies that require additional development to allow for the practical implementation of a high-integrity IBC-system for commercial and future military applications. The proposed system will be developed and tested initially in a System Integration Lab (SIL) and subsequently on a propulsion system test rig, which permits operational trials in a relevant environment.

There is a sizeable body of research establishing the benefits of Individual Blade Control (IBC) on rotorcraft including increased performance, improved handling qualities, extended component life, improved ride quality, reduced noise, and more. It was shown through a series of wind tunnel tests that IBC reduced the power required in forward flight conditions up to 7%. The research also observed up to a 12 dB (85%) reduction in noise generated by blade-vortex interaction (a major source of rotorcraft noise). IBC trades the weight and complexity of the swashplate mechanics for individual blade actuators integrated into the rotor. One significant challenge for IBC is getting a sufficiently high bandwidth actuator integrated into the rotating frame of the rotor hub as well as getting power and control signals across the rotating boundary. Toyon proposes to use our ultra-torque-dense (UTD) electric motor technology as a direct drive electromechanical servo motor to precisely control the blade pitch. By eliminating gearboxes and hydraulics we provide a low-maintenance, high-bandwidth and highly reliable zero-backlash servo actuation system for IBC."

In complex operational environments with a large number of data sources, decision-makers are continuously forced to make the tradeoff between making a decision based on an analysis of all the data and making a fast decision based on only a small amount of the data. Sentenai takes an automated approach to address the data engineering challenge of combining thousands of disparate data sources to perform comprehensive, interactive analysis of data. � Sentenai�s proposed solution uses our proven AI backend commercial solution, Tempest, to automate the data preparation thereby accelerating data processing for analysis,� and ultimately dramatically driving down the cost in time, personnel, and data-to-decision. Combined with BAE Systems Inc.�s (�BAE�) All-Source Track and Identity Fuser (ATIF) automated fuser technology, Sentenai will work with Navy data sets to create a more efficient and effective analyst workforce dedicated to supporting high-level decision-making rather than routine data engineering tasks. As such, we believe further technology development under the subject SBIR topic will contribute to solving this mission need. BAE Systems� All-Source Track and Identity Fuser (ATIF) is a TRL 9, state-of-the-art fusion engine that is or is in the process of being deployed on systems like the Navy E-2D and Air Force�s Network Centric Collaborative Targeting (NCCT).

These missiles can evade early warning systems since they cruise at a lower altitude, are highly maneuverable, travel over five times the speed of sound, and have a very low radar cross section. In the past few years there has been increasing interest in developing new EO/IR sensors to detect such missiles.��Due to their high velocity, they develop a hot plasma around them, with the nose cone and leading edges often becoming hotter than 1500C. Such hot surfaces provide a good thermal signature providing opportunity for novel EO/IR sensors to be developed.� Hypersonic missile early detection requires a highly sensitive wide area EO/IR sensor, identification requires a high resolution sensor, and tracking requires very low latency readout. Having all these features in a single imaging sensor is very difficult. For example, a large format 2K x 2K SWIR or MWIR infrared focalplane array imaging at rates required for tracking (20KHz frame rate) would dissipate over 200W of power, while traditional cooling methods can only handle focalplane arrays with at most a few watts of power dissipation. Moreover, such a FPA will produce 80 billion pixel/second data rate that cannot be handled by contemporary processors to detect and track the missile. SAAZ has been developing neuromorphic event-based readout EO/IR sensor technology that alleviates the above issues, offering the following advantages: In pixel detection of temporal contrast to reduce processing load� Asynchronous readout reduces data rate while maintaining very low latency for tracking� Increase probability of detection Reduce false alarm rate Sensor and processor compatibility enhancement Efficient Algorithms Optimized band� Radiation hardened ROIC and electronics suitable for space The ongoing developments offer a good foundation for starting the work on this Navy SBIR. Under this SBIR SAAZ proposes to add the use case to detect and track a hypersonic missile in its glide phase to terminal phase transition, as follows: To study the phenomenology of the glide phase and the terminal phase, especially developing a radiometric model for the transition between these phases� To develop a model that compares the performance by using a single EO/IR band with respect to several bands provide cost-benefit analysis� Conduct preliminary design of an optimal event driven neuromorphic sensor for the intended use case Develop a plan for sensor demonstration (field test) under phase II and develop a productization strategy to transition the technology to a program of record� The proposed multi EO/IR sensor event-based neuromorphic technology with embedded AI algorithms will greatly enhance Navy�s capabilities in protecting platforms against hypersonic missile threats."

This is mainly due to the fact that most were previously only capable of supporting a single polarization. However, an increasing number of new generation radar systems are fully polarimetric. With the ability to measure and simulate fully polarimetric radar signature data, new opportunities exist to improve non-cooperative target recognition (NCTR) capabilities. These include enhancing traditional techniques such as high range resolution (HRR), inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR), micro-Doppler, and jet engine modulation (JEM).� The Navy wishes to apply these capabilities to characterize or classify electrically large, nonstable targets such as the Boeing 737-800 commercial airliner and the Chinese Xian H-6 bomber. In this example, both aircraft have similar dimensions, with the Boeing 737-800 having a wingspan of 113� and length of 130� while the Xian H-6 bomber has a wingspan of 108� and length of 114�. However, each aircraft has distinct features. In particular, the H-6 has armament rails that could have missiles/bombs or fuel tanks attached to them. The engines on the H-6 are also closer to the fuselage than the 737-800. So, one would expect to see distinct radar signatures for the two aircraft.� Electro Magnetic Applications, Inc. (EMA) and Spann Consulting Services (SCS) propose an extensive simulation effort for the Phase I effort. This effort would include generation of fully polarimetric synthetic radar signature data for targets of interest to NAVAIR, including the Boeing 737-800 and the Xian H-6 bomber. Signature data will be generated over frequency bands of interest to NAVAIR, including UHF through X-band using the shooting and bouncing rays (SBR+) technique given its extensive validation history and advanced physics models for radar signature prediction of electrically large targets. The simulations will also consider CAD model fidelity to quantify the level of detail required in the CAD models for accurate predictions. Further, studies will be will performed to understand differences in signature data for slightly different versions of the aircraft. For example, the 737-800 and the 737-800 Max have slightly different dimensions and features and the Xian H-6 has different weapons configurations. Simulations may also be performed with full wave solvers for rotating/moving parts to address effects such as JEM since asymptotic techniques are typically not used for engine inlets and cavities. EMA and SCS will study the synthetic data to identify opportunities for improving NCTR techniques through distinct trends and behavior in fully polarimetric data over multiple radar frequency bands and over many aspect angles. The ideas that show the most promise for improving NCTR techniques will be implemented during the Phase II."

The ability to collect full-polarization returns in air-to-air systems is a recent advancement. Full-polarization scattering matrices offer more information, and potentially more discriminatory information to improve non-cooperative target recognition (NCTR) capabilities. This effort will compare the discriminatory capabilities of traditional single-polarization scattering matrices to full-polarization scattering matrices to understand when full-polarization can improve performance, as well as any computational resource trade-offs associated with leveraging full-polarization over single-polarization. Given that the targets of interest will be non-cooperative and non-stable, signatures of the targets will be generated with inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR)� simulation code. In addition to an empirical study on the discriminatory benefit of full-polarization scattering matrices, code and data products will be developed in order to enable reproducibility of the results as well as enable future work."

The fusion of measurements from multiple radar modes facilitates the determination of a comprehensive set of target characteristics such that a more informed assessment of a target�s threat level can be made. �The inclusion of surveillance mode track information provides target speed and altitude, High Range Resolution (HRR) provides gross physical features, and analysis of polarimetric ISAR/SAR data provides information regarding locations of larger physical features, micro-Doppler signatures from rotating features on helicopters, propeller aircraft and jets (micro-Doppler/JEM), and smaller structural details isolated by scattering variations (polarization). This information can be combined to assess the threat level of aircraft in the field. The accumulation of information from multiple radar modes must be balanced with resource utilization and probability of intercept. �Therefore, it is necessary to be able to assess the value of each additional radar mode to the fielded NCTR system. RDRTec proposes to expand on the modular building blocks within our Challenging target Airborne Detection & Discrimination (CADD) mode development testbed to create a suite of tools for the development and evaluation of radar modes suitable for aircraft NCTR. �CADD has been developed across a series of SBIR topics including: N141-067, N151-105, N152-083, N192-059, and N192-089. �The testbed includes a MATLAB suite of tools plus open architecture real-time C++ code designed to provide a means of developing, testing, and fielding advanced radar modes suitable for challenging target detection and discrimination. CADD creates a bridge to transition for this innovative aircraft NCTR radar system. The modular nature of CADD enables us to quantify the effectiveness of including each set of measurements (RCS, length, track data, polarization features, ISAR features, and micro-Doppler/JEM features) to screen out uninteresting targets and discriminate targets of interest for aircraft NCTR. � RDRTec will partner with HyPerComp to simulate radar signatures of aircraft targets of interest, which will then be ingested into the CADD testbed for NCTR system development and testing. Their simulations include 6 DOF models, high order EM solvers, data visualization tools, and RF data generation at a variety of viewing angles, radar frequencies, and polarizations. HyPerComp�s efforts in large-scale RF data generation (HDphysics-RF) for DoD�s various warfighter requirements is supported by several SBIR and non-SBIR contracts funded by a series of SBIR/RIF Army contracts W31P4Q-20-C-0025, W31P4Q-16-C-0045, W31P4Q-16-C-0080, W58RGZ-22-C-0037, W51701-22-C-0029, and many ongoing efforts with the Air Force, Navy, and DARPA. RDRTec has a long history of working with HyPerComp and ingesting their RF simulations into the CADD testbed."

To utilize this opportunity, QuNav proposes to develop an�Assured�Integrated�Mechanization of�PNT�(AIM-PNT). AIM-PNT integrates�three key enabling technologies�with�mutually complementary�benefitsinto a�joint system architecture:��� ��Inertial Navigation System�(INS): INS supports a completely self-contained navigation without relying on external sources. Yet, inertial accuracy will still eventually degrade to unacceptable levels. Hence, AIM-PNT uses INS as a core sensor and applies the other two enabling technologies in order to provide aiding observations to estimate INS error states and adjust navigation outputs thus mitigating the output drift.� ��Integration with Low Earth Orbit (LEO) SOOP: To fully utilize the potential advantages of LEO signals, the proposed AIM-PNT system will incorporate an innovative approach of a�software-defined�universal LEO�PNT receiver�(SUPER) toward a multiple-constellations, hybrid signals (non-cooperative and cooperative), and integrated (with an INS) LEO PNT solution capability.� ��Map-Matching of Earth Fields� Anomalies:�The use of LEO SOOP enhances the overall frequency diversity and received signal power thus improving the PNT resilience in contested environments. Yet, these signals are still susceptible to similar fundamental shortcomings as GNSS (i.e., unintentional interference, jamming and spoofing). To further enhance the PNT resilience, AIM-PNT augments the system architecture with aiding from Earth�s anomaly maps. To address the challenge of low-resolution maps, we propose to employ�analytic inversion�of Earth�s field anomalies into discrete sources for SLAM. By applying the inversion approach, the sources responsible for the anomalies in a small region (local scale and fine resolution) can be estimated accurately and then�registered upward�to fill the details of large scale and coarse resolution maps.� The sensor-fusion architecture utilizes a partitioned estimation scheme with separated processing of (i) linear measurements via an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and (ii) non-linear measurements via a Bayesian particle filter. A marginalized particle filter methodology is applied to enable a computationally-scalable joint processing.�In Phase I, technical feasibility and performance characteristics will be demonstrated and evaluated using a combination of simulated and experimental data.� To comply with Modular Open System Architecture (MOSA), input sensor messages and output navigation messages will be formulated using ASPN 2.2 format. This way, the AIM-PNT capability can be directly inserted into a Common Application Space of EGI-M."

To enable a robot to negotiate airfield access with air traffic control (ATC), Charles River Analytics proposes to design and demonstrate Advanced Speech Processing Interface for Autonomous Robots (ASPIAR), a generalizable language understanding module and speech interface for autonomous FOD-removal systems. To understand relevant ATC operations, ASPIAR has a contextually aware computational ATC and FOD domain model encoded in a systemic functional grammar (SFG). To reliably understand speech inputs, the SFG is used to generatively fine-tune an existing automated speech recognition (ASR) model to understand the idiosyncratic ATC communication language as spoken by air traffic controllers, while accommodating variation in accent, enunciation, and background noise. To generate speech responses, the ASPIAR-tailored ASR model generates text, with Synthetic Speech Markup Language metadata to enable expressive voice characteristics, then uses a text-to-speech processor to generate ATC-adherent speech. ASPIAR enables ATC to communicate with the robot using exactly the same verbal protocols they use with human debris-removal teams."

AVATAR will monitor continuous airfield radio signals and identify discrete speech segments despite challenges typical of airfield communications, including overlapping speakers, a variety of accents, and background noise. We will parse, classify, and filter the statements, relaying only those containing Air Traffic Control (ATC) instructions and questions for the relevant FOD-removal vehicles. When responding to ATC or negotiating permission for airfield navigation, the FOD-removal vehicle will have the ability to speak through AVATAR�s statement-generation module. Machine-generated messages will follow all airfield rules and regulations. Statements will be optimized for succinctness and directness to ensure a safe operating environment. The streamlined system will allow ATC to communicate with FOD-removal vehicles without unnecessary delay. In contrast to popular dialogue systems, AVATAR will maintain informational accuracy across conversations. The system will create a repository of situational information, including representations of ongoing movements of other airfield entities, histories of previous ATC statements, and details from daily operations plans. Relevant context from the repository will bolster the human-machine communication loop so that every ATC statement is understood accurately and every FOD-generated message is unambiguous. The system will incorporate geographic coordinates to provide spatial context for each translated statement and assist the FOD robot in averting potential collisions and airfield hazards. Each component of AVATAR will support an open interface with system users to promote compatibility. The system will provide processed data in any format necessary to ensure efficient communication. AVATAR-enabled FOD removal will increase airfield readiness and provide a much safer environment for naval aviation operations."

The current practical joining technology used in the thermoset composites includes (a) mechanical fastening and (b) adhesive bonding. Holes drilled in the composite associated with the bolted connection involve stress concentrations and fiber breakage, reducing the overall strength of the structure. Adhesive bonding using mainly epoxy adhesive is labor intensive and requires extensive surface preparation and long curing times. A mixture of bonded and bolted configurations has been found in most repaired composite structures. Given the process-driven initial bond quality and its property evolution under a service/environmental condition, the added strength and stiffness from bonding to a repaired structure has usually been ignored and only the bolted effect has been included during the design and certification of the repaired structure. To fill in the current technology gap and demonstrate a novel joining technology for connecting thermoplastic to thermoset and thermoset to thermoset composite parts, Global Engineering and Materials, Inc. and collaborators propose to develop a hybrid joining technology based on the combination of ultrasonic welding and friction drill fastening. To establish the relation between the process parameters and the thermomechanical response, high-fidelity simulation models will be developed to ensure the process-induced temperature field is sufficient enough to promote the interface bonding without damaging the composite adherends. A temperature-dependent cohesive model will be applied to ensure the minimum level of delamination damage after the installation of the friction drilling fasteners. In Phase I, the research team will fabricate bonded and hybrid connected composite coupons of thermoset and thermoplastic materials and compare their tensile and flexural performance with the corresponding coupons fabricated from the current best practice."

(Intellisense) proposes to develop a new GAMMA Mid-Wave IR FPA (GAMMA FPA) based on two innovations: a novel physical principle of MWIR detection and unique integration of existing technologies. Specifically, the innovation in the application of thermal dependence of liquid crystal rotational viscosity (GAMMA) for MWIR detection offers background-limited performance at sub-millisecond exposures. The integration of mature liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) microdisplay and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies enables a cost-effective solution for megapixel resolution in FPAs with very high fill factors and diffraction-limited pitch sizes, and supports rapid advances in technology readiness level (TRL). Thus, the GAMMA FPA is an ideal detector for tactical imaging applications with high dynamic range and low contrast, and is achievable in a low-SWaP format. In Phase I, Intellisense will design, model, simulate and fabricate the GAMMA FPA prototype. The prototype will be tested in the laboratory to characterize its performance in accordance with topic requirements to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept. The performance and SWaP of the detector array will be estimated. Intellisense will also design a Phase II prototype and develop a test plan and test procedures for Phase II prototype evaluation. In Phase II, Intellisense will optimize the design, fabricate, and test the detector array. We will detail a scalable fabrication process that provides a roadmap toward cost-effective production, conduct a trade study analysis of the array to establish the case for scalability to larger arrays, and deliver the GAMMA FPA integrated into a camera, together with test results, estimated manufacturing costs, and a plan for transition to Phase III."

The research team proposes to develop the Shipboard Intelligent Machinery Prognostic and Learning Environment (SIMPLE) using a highly flexible foundational learning technology that is equally adept at leveraging known physics-based models when available and using a purely data-driven approach when physics-based models are not available. Barron Associates, Inc. (BAI) has implemented and refined a suite of machine learning tools dubbed AURA (Algorithms for Uncertainty Representation and Analysis).� BAI�s AURA approach to machine learning is different from some other techniques and well-suited for the HM&E application due the ability to include prior physics-based models of any complexity (when available), explicitly include and quantify uncertainty, and optimize prediction accuracy with sparse training data while learning continually.� In many cases, even simple physics-based models that capture basic dynamics will reduce the amount of initial training data and training time that will be required for SIMPLE.� When physics-based models are not available, purely data-driven AURA will learn efficiently and still offer the primary benefits of the AURA methodology.� �� The research team will leverage its existing MCS land-based test environment (LBTE) for the Phase I simulation demonstration and also to generate additional training data as needed. The LBTE includes a fully functional MCS interfaced to a dynamic signal-level Plant Model Simulation of HM&E Systems. The ability of the MCS to control and monitor the ship propulsion and electric plants is dependent on the accuracy of the dynamic response analysis and the fidelity with which plant behavior is implemented in the LBTE plant model.� The comprehensive, complex, and accurate plant simulation model and the test platform built around it represent the collective efforts over the past decade to create an LBTE that facilitates successful shipboard integration.� This LBTE includes the ability to easily and efficiently generate and log realistic additional training data for the SIMPLE effort proposed herein. The Phase I work plan is designed to unequivocally establish that the proposed SIMPLE technology will lay a foundation for a highly-automated HM&E that features continuous self-learning and excels, in particular, in the presence of failures and/or damage. Phase I will culminate in a LBTE simulation-based demonstration of multiple realistic scenarios that cover a range of normal and degraded conditions."

However, faults and errors can occur unexpectedly, causing downtime and potentially hazardous situations. To address this issue, TDI Novus proposes PROPEL to detect, analyze, and classify faults and errors in real-time using probabilistic fault models trained on historical sensor data. The system can provide timely alerts to the autonomy software, off-board operators, or onboard engineers. Further, PROPEL autonomously creates resolution strategies to correct for these faults. The use of machine learning techniques enables the system to continuously improve its performance and accuracy over time. Once a fault has been detected, the system can autonomously find a plan of action to resolve the issue using a self-improving automated planning agent. The agent takes into account various factors such as the severity of the fault, availability of resources, and operational constraints to come up with the best course of action. Additionally, PROPEL can continuously learn new plans using an in-system simulation process, which allows it to adapt to changing conditions and improve its decision-making capabilities.

As testers execute formalized assessments during these test events,�issues arise, and the issues are documented in software problem reports (SPRs). Multiple factors may limit the ability of a tester to properly document issues for future replication or investigation, such as the rapid pace and sensitivity at which the tests are performed. When the issue gets assigned to a developer, significant data required to repeat or categorize the issue may not be available due to lack of documentation or amplifying information. Situations like these lead to a significant number of problem reports going unresolved and delivered in the deployed product. Altron is proposing to conduct research and development (R&D) to determine the technical feasibility of creating a novel technology that will perform data aggregation and data analytics to correlate system inputs, system logs and metadata to support SPR capture.�As the data types fed into this correlation algorithm increase, an ontology will be created that categorizes and details the bugs. These captured details will help unburden testers from having to investigate many bugs themselves. Instead, they can create a SPR with the details this technology�provides and continue with their test plan. With this comprehensive dataset captured by the technology, developers will have reliable recreation and amplifying information at their disposal to diagnose issues."

Boston Engineering is under contract to redesign a commercial robotic system with components appropriate for defense applications, including addressing ruggedization, design for manufacturing, cybersecurity, and system certification. Boston Engineering previously conceptually designed a means to convert the above water crawler to operate underwater as part of the execution of SBIR N161-044 to develop Maritime Ultraviolet Antifouling (MUVA) capability. Therefore, we have shown how use one system could be designed to operate above and below water with minimum configuration changes. A system is proposed that will have over 50% of its design leverageable for this program (N231-031), including open architecture software, electronics, and user interface. Advances for the proposed underwater variant will include packaging design appropriate for underwater operation, specific navigation capability for boat and ship hulls, and the automation required to deliver the desired cavitation jetting to remove biofouling. An advantage of vacuum- or suction-hold is the ability to operate on non-ferrous surfaces, such as SHT: Anechoic coating. The envisioned robotic delivery technology uses compliant tracks enabling the ability to traverse non-smooth surfaces and most protrusions typical on the hull surface, including slopes (e.g., conformal arrays) and ridges. Fine positioning features of a robotic arm are compared with simpler but equally effective set of controlled, fixed nozzles on the front of the delivery system."

Top performance attributes of the system will be focused on collecting the appropriate data and most importantly the communication interaction from the glider via satellite, radio frequency, and acoustic emissions. GLSV is well positioned to help the US Navy develop a mission ready system for a launchable device meeting all of the requirements outlined within solicitation N231-032. GLSV is currently in the prototype testing phase of a positive buoyancy system utilized on Acoustic Device Countermeasures (ADC) for the US Navy. This GLSV developed technology can be scaled as needed to meet the design requirements. GLSV�s proposed glider device will iterate off of our existing ADC concept, while leveraging the experience gained to provide a robust solution to the US Navy. GLSV will incorporate all relevant components in the baseline model. Integrated components within the device include but are not limited to the battery, valves, high pressure gas cylinder, depth sensor, SSP, controller, and communication hardware. GLSV will team with Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI) for this Phase I effort to develop and design a communications system tailored to the glider requirements. MTRI is experienced in both hardware and simulation development and will help GLSV to develop a prototype ready design. Using established oceanographic calculations, GLSV will integrate a COTS sensor suite to determine the SSP using measured temperature, salinity, and pressure data profiles collected from inside the water column. GLSV will source all materials needed for fabrication and assembly of the glider during the Phase I effort. By sourcing components during the Phase I option, GLSV will be prepared to order materials for prototyping at the kickoff of Phase II."

The measurement of the sound speed profile (SSP) in the marine environment is required for calibration of naval sonar systems engaged in undersea warfare (USW) operations. Current systems for SSP acquisition, including expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) and BT sonobuoys do not provide a persistent measurement capability or propulsion for navigation and station keeping. Underwater buoyancy glider systems are a proven technology for persistent sensing in the marine environment, with systems currently deployed around the world and in a variety of measurement applications, including naval oceanography, weather forecasting, and oil and gas environmental monitoring. These systems are often large, expensive and require surface vessels to support launch and recovery operations. The proposed Slocum-A glider system is an A-size sonobuoy launcher compatible buoyancy glider system that will enable persistent environmental and oceanographic measurements in a low-cost, compact, air-launchable form factor. The glider system will leverage class-leading Slocum glider technology and satellite communications to enable seamless exfiltration of measurement data to nearby vessels, as well as over the horizon to naval oceanographic, scientific, and commercial databases. In this SBIR we will design and develop the glider system by performing engineering and trade studies to develop miniaturized versions of Slocum glider components and assemblies and integrate these subsystems into a buoyancy glider system that is compatible with A-size sonobuoy launchers. The Slocum-A�glider system will be equipped with sensors and communications technology capable of delivering SSP data to tactical decision aids on nearby vessels, and with a maximum operational depth of 200m."

Makai will develop a continuous learning model and framework using convolution neural network models to provide ATR with pixel-level classification. As with any statistics-based learning model, machine learning performance is best when used on targets with characteristics to the training data. Future implementation requires continuous improvement and tuning as additional datasets become available over time. Makai will utilize the convolution neural networks with online machine learning to provide a step-change improvement in automated target recognition, producing higher performance and lower Probability of False Alarm in complex and cluttered environments; maintaining processing applicable for both onboard and post-mission analysis."

It is critical that machine learning is exploited fully for national defense. The easiest deployment of DNNs for the Navy is evaluating growing data sources for intelligence and actionable information. One challenge with this application is that DNNs hallucinate and generate false-positive detections. Even at 99% accuracy, false positives can greatly outnumber true positives if targets occur infrequently. This is best captured by the �mean average precision� (mAP) performance metric. We propose to eliminate false positives with several algorithms that collaborate to boost the mAP of the combined ATR classifier."

Some UAS of interest are lacking in diverse exemplary images both in term of point of view and environment. Furthermore, visible images alone may be insufficient to achieve NAVSEA�s performance targets, necessitating the usage of thermal infrared (TIR) image sensors as well. Currently, many of the generative modeling techniques are applied solely to the visible wavelengths. Generative modelling approaches using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown some modicum of success augmenting visible image datasets. Hence, there is a need to create a GAN for RGB+TIR images of UASs that could augment current training sets in a functionally useful way in a variety of contexts. The final generative output would need to be adaptable to accept various formats of imagery, with varying resolutions and sensors. Various quantitative and qualitative metrics should be identified and explained, with priority to predicting utility of generated datasets for machine learning applications. Lynntech�s Intelligent Systems group has several years of experience researching and developing GANs for applications involving various IR image bands, which is a challenge due to the emissive nature of thermal IR component, and the lower spatial resolution, yet greater bit depth of the IR sensor data relative to visible cameras. Therefore, based on this and the need of NAVSEA Lynntech, Inc. proposes to develop a Synthesizer of Queryable Unmanned Aerial System Heterogenous EO/IR Datasets (SQUASHED) which is a scalable software suite capable of creating (1) multi-group UAS target extraction and pose estimation,� (2) posed-based instance segmentation-map generation with various backgrounds, (3) photorealistic UAS insertion to novel instance backgrounds with a generative adversarial network (GAN) while blending with the different imaging/environmental conditions of the background and/or sensor characteristics of the camera, and (4) domain transfer of different imaging modalities (thermal, RGB) with a conditional GAN. The focus of the SQUASHED R&D effort is to realize a tool that can fabricate image frames of relevant UAS platforms, with a goal to ultimately produce mission-focused synthetic data that has more training utility than available sets. This synthetic dataset will be queryable in the sense that it with be extensively labeled according not only according to class type, but many other characteristics and metadata, i.e., orientation, pixels on target, and even weather. The ultimate utility of such a scalable SQUASHED resource will be evaluated by the specificity of any derivative machine learning trained with this resource on evaluation sets chosen by NAVSEA."

The sonar images must be efficiently compressed to increase onboard storage and enable large amounts of data through water transfer. Mathematically, the sonar images can be viewed as a linear combination of some appropriate Green�s functions. Thus, they are highly coherent correlated and the associated matrices are rank deficient. This unique property can be exploited to achieve better sonar image compression. To this end, Corvid Technologies (Corvid) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) propose to develop an efficient data-driven dictionary sparse coding-based sonar image compression algorithm. Firstly, the team will employ butterfly factorization to extract the salient features at different levels from the training data, then we will use a deep dictionary learning algorithm to build a more accurate dictionary by taking the butterfly factorization results as input. Once the dictionary is learned, Corvid and LBNL will use a Bayesian compressive sensing approach to extract the sparse coefficients of each image more efficiently. For the scenarios that multiple sonar images are associated with the same scene, we will use a multi-task Bayesian compressive sensing method to obtain more noise robust results by exploiting the joint information among those images. Due to sparse coding, the extracted coefficients can serve as features for better automatic target recognition performance."

The current fleet is tasked with specific operational conditions which cause the current power systems to operate at inefficient conditions, leading to increased cost and downtime. To solve this problem, GreenSight proposes an efficient electrical power generation and deployment system named OsmoFlow. It is specifically sized to meet the average operational duty cycle requirements of the US Navy, and their associated 34 and 40 foot patrol boats. As part of this proposal, we plan to fully characterize the performance requirements of� the vessel and develop an electrical power generation and deployment scheme to best fit their needs. Overall fuel energy conversion efficiency will be examined and account for generator operation, energy storage capability, energy deployment, and performance optimization. GreenSight�s solution is centered around a set of core components including a modular axial flux motor pack, high-capacity lithium battery pack, heavy-fuel and diesel capable generator units, and integrated power electronics. In addition, the architecture proposed allows multiple benefits not initially sought by the solicitation. These include, clandestine operations modes for covert missions, low overall noise signature, lower cooling requirements, and modularity allowing for lower serviceability requirements. In order to better quantify these effects, a set of development tasks are proposed to further mature the design described. An axial flux motor concept will be developed and optimized around an 80kW modular pack, and designed to be stacked to fulfill a range of power requirements. Next, a battery system study will be done to determine adequate sizing relative to the vessel�s size, power generation capacity, and anticipated duty cycle. A power generation study will be conducted to evaluate the design changes necessary to increase the capacity of our current heavy fuel generator design. And finally, plans will be developed for a Phase II demonstrator assembly."

The current HTS-DG being installed on the USS Ft. Lauderdale displays the first large scale installation of HTS on a Navy Platform. During installation, however, the predetermined, fixed lengths are either too long or too short due to a variety of reasons such as ship design modifications occurring after cable manufacturing. To accommodate these slight changes in length during shipboard installation, additional fixed lengths need to be either added or taken away to accommodate the actual/final length for the HTS-DG cable. The changes in length needed result in unwanted delays and expenses to the installation process. Similar to traditional Cu based DG cables, the Navy is seeking solutions for an HTS-DG cable installation process where the cable can be cut to length and ultimately connected to the power supply. Energy to Power Solutions (e2P) of Tallahassee, FL, in collaboration with the Florida State University Center for Advanced Power Systems (FSU-CAPS), proposes to design, fabricate, test, and install a rugged, prototype HTS-DG cable into a pre-installed, fixed length, empty conduit that possesses complex and contour bends similar to those expected on a Navy ship. The primary focus of the proposed Phase I effort will be to develop complete, fully functional systems, meeting specifications, which includes: a rugged HTS-DG cable bundle, the Warm-to-Cold (W/C) termination design, the key steps necessary for a successful HTS-DG cable installation process, and finally the electrical connection of the HTS-DG cable to the W/C termination. The proposed e2P-CAPS Phase I effort will fully simulate the entire HTS-DG cable shipboard installation process, rugged HTS cable bundle, and W/C termination hardware. The elegance of e2P�s proprietary W/C termination design and cable installation process being submitted is that it is HTS-DG cable configuration independent. All HTS cable bundle types, regardless of configuration, will work with e2P�s proprietary W/C termination design and cable installation technique. e2P has selected the Simple-Insulating-Stack (SIS) as the baseline HTS-DG cable but is prepared to demonstrate the installation technique on various HTS cable configurations, such as the CORC and CORT, to highlight the versatility and adaptability of the process. This approach allows for the standardization of the installation process, taking the focus off the type of HTS-DG cable. With this approach, the HTS cable bundle type is no longer a limiting factor for NSWC during any future installations, opening the opportunity for streamlining and increasing efficiency when implementing HTS power cable systems across any Navy Platform."

A bundle of, or cable containing 40 RE-Ba2Cu3O7-d (REBCO) tapes would preferably be spooled at lengths exceeding 800 ft. that can be pulled through an exiting conduit or cryostat that may contain several 90-degree bends. The cable needs to withstand a pulling load of up to 1,000�lbs without experiencing any degradation. Once pulled, the cable would be cut and terminated such that each of the 40 tapes are connected in series to form the degaussing cable. Each tape in the cable should be able to carry a nominal current of 100 A with an isolation voltage of 600 V. Advanced Conductor Technologies (ACT) proposes to develop rugged HTS degaussing cables based on its Conductor on Round Core (CORC�) cable technology that has been developed for power cables in Navy ships and electric aircraft and for high-field magnet applications. During the proposed SBIR, CORC� cables will be developed in three steps to make them suitable for use as shipboard degaussing cables. First, CORC� cables will be developed in which each of the tapes, or tape pairs, are insulated from each other. Second, ACT will select high-strength, flexible cable cores that allow repeated bending of the cable during installation when the cable is pulled through a conduit. Third, reliable, and practical CORC� cable terminations that allow each of the tapes or tape pairs to be soldered individually on-site to form the series-connected bundle needed in degaussing cables will also be developed. The Phase I work will be supported by characterization of prototype cables and connectors to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and prepare for the Phase II program in which a full-scale prototype is developed and delivered to the Navy."

Specifically, the innovation in active, bi-directional ranging with digital synchronous sampling and detection will dramatically increase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which in turn acts as a key enabler for the device to reliably overcome extremely harsh conditions such intense blowing rain and motion induced by rough seas. As a result, this device offers to provide accurate distance measurement and digital communications under all conditions, which directly address the PMS-400 requirements and offers additional benefits of lower probability of intercept and detection. In Phase I, Intellisense will demonstrate the feasibility of the RECOUPLE device by developing a proof-of-concept prototype and testing it under simulated adverse environmental conditions. Distance measurement capabilities will be established through computer modeling that is calibrated based on test results giving better fidelity and accuracy than would otherwise be possible from an uncalibrated model. In the Phase I Option, an initial design specifications and capabilities description document will be created in preparation for Phase II. In Phase II, Intellisense plans to deliver a prototype distance measurement system and communication device for evaluation against performance goals defined in the Phase II statement of work.

For the safety of UNREP operation, it is crucial to establish an advanced sensing-communication system that can 1) consistently and accurately monitor the distance between two ships in all different weather conditions; 2) promptly deliver the measured distant information to the crew members and the station; and 3) enable secure and clear voice communication between the captains on two ships.

Some mission packages include the Mine Countermeasure (MCM) MP, the Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) MP, the Surface Warfare (SUW) MP, as well as general surveillance. To control the vehicles, the Navy is using the Multiple Vehicle Communications System (MVCS) which provides the ability to simultaneously communicate and coordinate multiple unmanned vehicles via a mesh network. However, the current network utilizes Line of Sight (LOS) S-band signals which suffer from relatively low bandwidths and are susceptible to jamming and spoofing attacks. Therefore, the Navy has an urgent need for innovative Satellite Communications (SATCOM) prototypes which provide resilient SATCOM access to Navy unmanned assets, specifically to send or receive large data sets. Many commercial of the shelf (COTS) SATCOM systems are available; however, none of these systems are suitable for use on UUV applications due to the large hydrostatic pressures experienced during submersion. In addition, most COTS SATCOM systems are band specific and are only designed to operate within one SATCOM band or constellation."

Properties such as hardness, tensile strength, ultimate elongation, viscoelasticity, and temperature-dependent strain recovery are broadly tunable through selection of crosslinkers, curatives, prepolymer synthesis options, solvents, and fillers.

Mines are inexpensive to fabricate and easy to deploy, making them a favorite tool of our adversaries. The Navy is actively developing new countermine technologies to defeat this threat more quickly and efficiently than ever before. However, countermining operations still require manual battle damage assessment (BDA) to verify target neutralization, slowing operational tempo. Future mine neutralization systems will likely include ultrashort baseline arrays (USBLA) of hydrophones for acoustic communication and tracking. Opportunistically, the USBLA will also capture the underwater explosion (UNDEX) waveforms from the countermine charge and any sympathetic mine detonations. These waveforms contain sufficient information for near-instantaneous and automatic BDA. Creare proposes to develop the Automated UNDEX Damage Assessment Tool (AUDAT), a suite of algorithms suitable for deployment on a low-power embedded processor that analyze UNDEX waveforms to determine the number of UNDEX events and the bearing, range, depth, and estimated yield of each event. This automated tool will supplant manual BDA, increasing mission tempo. With slight modifications, AUDAT algorithms can also be used for automated battle damage assessment following offensive mining operations. In Phase I we will collect sample UNDEX data on a simulated USBLA, develop candidate AUDAT algorithms, and demonstrate key algorithm performance on a low power embedded system. In Phase II we will refine our algorithms to deal with real-world complications and demonstrate end-to-end performance on a custom embedded prototype."

However, their benefits vary across the ship�s speed range and have not provided a consistent benefit across a broad range of Froude numbers (0.15 � 0.75). Additionally, some HHAs rely on shipboard hydraulic systems, which can lead to cost and reliability issues.

PacMar Technologies proposes its Bow Lifting Body (BLB) technology as the hydrodynamic hull appendage solution for meeting the Navy�s requirements.�Over 20 years of marine technology development using state-of-the-art modeling and simulation coupled with correlation to scale model and full-scale prototype tests have advanced our knowledge related to lifting body ships at various sizes and speeds.� PacMar Technologies will leverage this experience to design and integrate the advanced, wide-range HHA solution.�The BLB is an approach toward efficiency through a combination of wave cancellation, wetted area reduction, and dynamic lift.� The integration of a BLB to an existing hull can be accomplished without drastically altering the vessel�s overall draft, length, or beam.� The only change would be a faired section near the bow to provide a structural joint from the hull to the BLB. Since no mission-critical components typically exist in this area of the bow, no negative impacts to vessel operations are introduced. �Additionally, the added mass of the BLB reduces pitch motions when operating in a seaway and can also reduce added resistance.� The benefits of a BLB also scale extremely well to a variety of hull sizes and hull configurations.�PacMar Technologies has successfully applied these systems to monohulls, trimarans, and catamarans of various sizes in past projects."

Procuring commercially available hull designs provide a cost effective means of achieve this. However, commercially available platforms are typically not designed for fuel efficient operations over broad operational speed ranges required for military vessels; i.e., lower transit speed, endurance range speed, and higher sustained sprint speed. The speed time profile for a USV will vary highly between peace time and war time operations, making broad range fuel efficiency more critical. Existing passive Hydrodynamic Hull Appendages (HHA) have demonstrated the ability to reduce hull resistance and vertical accelerations, and thereby, improve fuel efficiency and vessel motions. The benefits of passive HHA are optimized for the operating speed of the vessel and not to provide�a consistent benefit across a broad range of Froude numbers (0.15 � 0.75). A reliable, wide-range HHA is required to enable commercially available hull designs to provide affordable, reliable, fuel-efficient capability. To achieve this the HHA will have to be actively controlled to optimize efficiency across a large speed range. Development of a reliable, wide-range HHA will better enable a modified Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) hull-form to meet USV and combatant operational requirements, improving the autonomous systems endurance, persistence, and reliability. The development targets hulls 150�-400� in length. Innovation is required to develop an advanced HHA that provides fuel savings across a wide range of Froude numbers and provides reliable operation with minimal maintenance. Additionally, the HHA must be readily integrated into an existing hull form, such that it does not require significant modification of existing commercial hull forms. The advanced HHA will target a minimum 5-10% fuel efficiency benefit across a wide operational speed range and shall target a total acquisition and integration cost of less than $750K per unit to provide a Return On Investment (ROI) within 1-2 years. The number of units required is dependent on how broadly the technology can be applied; for planning purposes ~10-20 units would be required over a 10-year period. The advanced HHA�s performance will be assessed against the power delivered ratio for a hull form without an HHA as compared to a hull form with an HHA.

A failure of JBD#3 to lower creates the greatest need for a redundant system. Failures can occur in either the electrical system or mechanical components of the blast door�s electromechanical actuator (EMA); resulting in delays to critical operations. The current safety protocol for lowering a JBD in the event of a primary failure mode is crew member intensive, can take in excess of 12 minutes and has the potential to cause damage to humans and equipment alike. The current emergency retraction process uses gravity and a friction brake operated by crew members to close the JBD.� Higher than normal resistance in the EMA due to minor damage of the EMA�s roller screw assembly has been identified as a critical issues for current emergency retraction processes.� In this failure mode, the force due to gravity is insufficient to retract the JBD. The proposed improvement to the EMA provides a solution to all identified failure modes, applies to all JBDs on the vessel and potentially other EMA applications. Orbital Traction, Ltd. proposes to design and integrate into the current EMAs a remotely controlled, secondary actuator to lower the JBD in the event of a primary system failure e.g.� electrical system, drive motor or control. The back-up actuator provides maximal torque override (MTO) allowing for full system torque to be provided through the EMA using the MTO actuator in conjunction with a backup electrical power or portable power supply.� In the event of a primary system failure, a crew member remotely controls the MTO to actively lower the JBD. As a backup system, the MTO will lower the JBD in approximately 2 minutes, which is significantly less than the current 12-minute requirement. The MTO actuator is directly coupled to the EMA�s electric motor on the far side of the roller screw interface.� The MTO is a low speed, high torque, rotary actuator that can be hardwired using a range of back-up electrical power sources including 24V portable equipment or power supply. The MTO has a small electric motor and an infinitely variable transmission (IVT).� The IVT allows the MTO to provide very high torque into the EMA drive mechanism with the small motor. The IVT utilizes a proprietary adjustable speed drive coupled with a geared differential.� The MTO�s ability to deliver full system torque will overcome currently identified limitations associated with higher than normal resistance due to minor damage of the EMA�s roller screw assembly and allow emergency operation of the EMA. The MTO will not impact the EMA�s function during normal operations."

Each JMB consists of six large, water-cooled plates located immediately behind planes running up their engines prior to catapult launch. On occasion, either due to loss of power or other mechanical issue, the JBD plates are stuck in the raised position. This situation slows or even halts normal flight operations until the stuck plate can be cleared. The current process to lower a stuck JBD plate is time consuming and awkward to implement. This Navy solicitation requests the development of an effective solution to the JMD-stuck issue. In particular, a device that ensures safe, rapid and controlled lowering of the heavy plate is sought. During the proposal preparation process, the ZKxKZ team designed a beta version solution for controlling the descent speed of a JBD plate. We call our conceptual hardware solution the Emergency Remotely Activated Lowering Device (EmRALD). EmRALD adds a simple component in the space that currently houses the EMD. This component limits the speed at which the plate can fall when decoupled from the EMD actuator. Two versions of EmRALD were conceived, one that will result in the plate falling at an accelerating but acceptable rate, and a second that maintains a programmable descent rate, that could for example have the plate move more quickly initially, then slow prior to touching down at the deck interface. In Base Phase I ZKxKZ will complete a detailed design of the EmRALD system, then build and test a prototype system. �The Navy will be invited to participate in person at the hardware testing. In the Option, we will update the design and prototype to reflect results and Navy comments from the Phase I Base testing event. The proposed development takes advantage of directly related hardware system developments performed by ZKxKZ. For example, we developed a solution to actuator binding in large Air Force WS3 systems, built into floors of US and NATO aircraft hangers, used to store nuclear weapons near the delivery aircraft. We also developed a composite solution to Nimitz carrier elevator binding caused by damaged steel stanchions. Our stanchions, currently installed on every Nimitz class ship, operate in close proximity to carrier deck JBDs."

The SPE is a novel, patented, high-torque compact drive train that is part of Fathom5�s Tesar Lift� developmental product line of electromagnetic actuators. �The SPE input will be outfitted with a bull gear driven by an idler/pinion that is connected to a battery powered lower-torque electric motor, hereafter referred to as the lowering motor. �The lowering motor engages the bull gear. The battery system will be charged while the JBD is in nominal operations. In the event of a loss of primary and back-up EMA power, the Lowering Motor can be remotely commanded to lower each of the JBD panels. The lowering motor and bull-gear assembly will not be sized to conduct efficient raising operations but will be able to directly back drive the SPE geartrain from its input. This allows the lowering effort to be reverse driving (rather than back driving) the linear screw, removing a significant amount of the lowering resistance. This has the added effect of placing a reduction ratio in between the EMA motor and linear screw, providing more mechanical advantage to the existing EMA assembly and lowering its overall current requirements during door acceleration and deceleration jerks. The expected operation time under the lowering�motor is estimated to be one minute or less per panel. Total emergency lowering time would depend on the number of panels that could be simultaneously stowed as determined by the result of this Phase I effort. �The SPE is a novel eccentric gearbox allowing high volumetric torque density. The reduction in the number of parts compared to traditional eccentric reducers allows the tailoring of strength and reliability properties depending on application with a focus on high torque industrial applications. Fathom5's SPE differs from existing eccentric gearboxes by using spur tooth shapes instead of cycloidal discs, which increases load capacity and durability."

Crew members have different training and roles to perform on a ship like the Constellation Class Frigate. �Therefore, our approach to visualization recognizes that different roles might require different methods for visualizing the current situation. �We identify these perspectives as: functional, regional, and system-level. �Essentially, this allows crew members to be presented a perspective and receive information structured within the context of their role on the ship. This accelerates their ability to absorb information. Modeling and simulation, using the Modelica modeling language, allows us to leverage our expertise to develop models of the ship and its important systems, subsystems, and components.� We can use these models to seed fault conditions and run simulations to generate data resembling current data acquisition systems that the ship may use.� This allows us to create a significant number of different fault scenarios, of varying levels of complexity, to provide a strong foundation for testing and analysis of our proposed solution. Adding the modeling and simulation capabilities allows us to leverage some of our existing technologies in the Fault Management (FM) space, which provides an interesting path forward.� Instead of just monitoring fault conditions, we can leverage the data acquired by a monitoring system, process it with a virtual cognitive ability using digital twin models, and leverage corrective action abilities to support autonomous real-time active fault management. The phase I project goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and tease out the requirements for future development and implementation of a Centralized Fault Monitoring capability that incorporates advancements in human & machine cognitive interfacing to yield faster and more effective fault management in adverse, multi-failure conditions."

Users can add rules to expand what is recorded. RECORDER also provides a graphical user interface to review recent data and manually initiate recording, which it uses to suggest new rules to capture similar data in the future."

With the planned work in this SBIR, the SlateSafety BAND V2 aims to run government furnished exertional heat illness (EHI) risk algorithms and become a valuable tool for researchers to further develop these algorithms.� � Overall, the BAND V2 is a wearable armband that aims to prevent injuries or deaths due to heat stress and overexertion in real-time. The BAND V2 can measure heart rate, core temperature, exertion, calories burned, step count, resting heart rate, heart rate variability, and comes equipped with the ability to turn off or on GPS location, fall detection, a panic button, and more. SlateSafety�s BAND V2 is specifically designed to withstand rugged environments in an unobtrusive manner. The strap goes around the wearer�s upper arm, making it easy to use while still wearing clothing and performing various activities. The BAND V2 is simple to put on and the entire system from the chargers to the straps to the software are built for large scale deployments of 100s or 1000s with minimal management overhead.

Thus, technologies that replace legacy lubrication methods can significantly reduce overall vehicle ownership costs.� United Protective Technologies (UPT) has developed two innovative nanocomposite self-lubricating coating technologies for high wear applications common in UAV and attritable engine designs.� The first innovative coating has been designed to be used in dry applications where it has been proven to reduce contact friction from 0.8 to below 0.1 for steel-on-steel interfaces and has reduced wear by several orders of magnitude compared to grease lubricated commercial coatings. The second has been designed for use in fuel lubricated applications where it transforms jet fuel into a highly lubricious film for oil-like friction and wear performance. Applying these corrosion resistant thin film coatings to engine bearings and other critical wear surfaces will provide�oil lubricated levels of performance�during even high G and oil starved situations as well as potentially eliminating the�maintenance necessary for long term storage of�attritable aircraft technology"

The National Defense Strategy (NDS) identifies a central challenge to US prosperity and security as the reemergence of long-term, strategic competition posed by Russia and China. The Navy is responding by developing a range of UAV, Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUV), and Unmanned Surface Vessels (USV) to enable a shift in focus towards smaller platforms that are more dispersed in their operation[1]. The increase in the geographical scale of the battlefield will drive the need for a larger quantity of expendable and attritable solutions, in addition to the existing larger, higher cost, lower quantity platforms. An important piece to successfully executing this strategy will be the development of low cost, easy to manufacture weapon systems. There is a unique opportunity to simplify existing designs that can be realized as a consequence of designing for limited life or single use applications. Traditional approaches to engineering development leverage the so-called legacy design approach. An approach which seeks to minimize disruption to the function of the system by minimizing change. By leveraging already working designs it is possible to reduce development cost and time and consequently, many of the mechanical systems currently implemented in small attritable engines are scaled down versions of those implemented in larger engines. This approach has significant limitations; it obscures a region of design space that is more desirable for these special engines - i.e. alternative concepts that may have winning attributes in the small engine space will not be considered if solutions are simply scaled versions of larger designs. Additionally, implementing designs which leverage legacy-based systems can often overlook system level improvements. As pointed out by the author�s of this topic, traditional flow through and recirculating oil systems can account for up to 30% of overall propulsion system weight, yet these designs haven�t changed in almost 100 years. A fundamental design philosophy utilized in Zulu Pod�s technology is to look at bearing lubrication and thermal management from a new perspective, specifically focused on conditions relevant to small attritable/expendable engines.� In this design space wear and durability constraints are less severe and the primary design objective is to prevent catastrophic failure modes. It is then possible to innovate by separating the functions of lubrication and cooling by pushing the design in regimes where lubrication is optimized, and cooling needs are minimized. Preliminary results suggest that mechanical systems which do not need to be operated for tens of thousands of low cycle fatigue conditions will require only modest amounts of lubrication."

A strategy for one-time use scenarios is a class of materials that ablate or chemically react and transform into gases under extreme thermal loads. Carbon phenolic ablators are advanced composite ablators that have found growing usage, spurring an industry need for accurate and appropriate material models. Ablative phenolic carbon is vulnerable to a number of aging phenomena due to the chemically-organic nature of phenolic resin. Coupled with the wide variety of microstructures and chemistries in ablative phenolic carbon composites, the ability to predict actual material responses in real world scenarios is greatly diminished. In response to the Navy's need to predict the effects of aging on the ablative response of phenolic composites, Corvid Technologies proposes development of a material model plugin to the CHarring Ablator Response code (CHAR), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration�s (NASA�s) state-of-the-art ablation code. This proposed plugin can be used to modify the underlying material property inputs for phenolic carbon composites of a given microstructure and chemistry as a function of aging mechanism and time. Corvid will develop the CHAR aging material model plugin using a multiple-length-scale modeling and simulation approach which will handshake chemistry affects from the atomistic scale with Molecular Dynamics to the microstructural evolution as a function of time at the meso-scale with Phase-Field Modeling. The results will be homogenized into long-time scale trends that will be able to forecast the material effects of aging up to 60 years. Once developed, the end product will be a fast calculation tool capable of applying effects of multiple aging mechanisms simultaneously to estimate current material properties and response. Current approaches do not account for aging when simulating ablative response, and while there are a few experimental investigations into accelerated aging effects, the effect of long-time scales (i.e. greater than 3 years) on ablative behavior is currently unknown. Corvid will leverage our extensive multi-length-scale material modeling expertise and massively-parallel high-performance computing (HPC) system to bridge both time and length scales to deliver a model that can account for the diverse array of composite microstructures and chemistries of phenolic-carbon composites, as well as the specific effects of multiple aging mechanisms on those composite microstructural features."

Phenolic-based composites are at the forefront of thermal protection system (TPS) innovation because of their desirable ablative properties. Due to the demand for these types of systems, tools are required to determine the viability of a material from manufacture to service use. The Navy has identified a critical need to predict the effects of long-term storage on the degradation of phenolic materials and how material aging impacts mission performance. Making these predictions based on real-time data is infeasible given the rate of advancing technology, and therefore accelerated aging techniques are used to model changes to materials. The standard physical methods for accelerated aging, such as exposure to aggravated heat or oxidation, can be lengthy and expensive and are limited to what can be tested within a lab. CFD Research proposes the development of additional tools within the Hypersonic Environment Analysis Toolkit (HEAT) framework for fast-running material property aging models which will be integrated with existing transient thermal response and hypersonic TPS flight performance tools within the HEAT toolset. This will provide a method for analyzing how material aging will impact hypersonic TPS performance years into the future as a function of storage conditions. The material aging models will be anchored using accelerated aging experimentation data provided by partner Kratos SRE."

As attritable and expendable unmanned platforms become more common, cost is becoming a larger constraining factor in system specifications. Current high-performance RF systems such as phased arrays meet mission requirements but are costly and consume significant power. Gradient Index Lens Switchable Beam Arrays are a solution that is passive, low cost, extremely high bandwidth, and can handle high power. However, GRIN lenses have current limitations in size, cost, and manufacturability. High Dk material and broad permittivity range is necessary for volume, mass, and cost reduction of GRIN lenses since cost is proportional to print time and hence volume. Transformation optics techniques can be used to reduce the required size of lenses, but the methods require both high Dk�s and broad permittivity ranges to achieve reasonable compression ratios. Materials are available with these high Dk values, however, assembling bulk dielectrics to achieve greater ranges introduces step changes in permittivity, which reduce aperture efficiency and increase sidelobes. A smooth gradient is required across the total dielectric range, which is achievable with additive manufacturing (AM) and tuned lattice structures. AM enables design freedom for gradient indices with tuned lattices mixing air and dielectric to achieve effective permittivities, but current materials and systems require a tradeoff between low RF loss or high frequency performance. Fortify has developed a line of low-loss RF photopolymer composites for the DLP Flux system that enables RF components to be built with stable dielectrics, fine features, and the lowest loss on the market. By combining these materials in different areas of a GRIN lens, broad Dk ranges can be achieved to implement compression ratios > 5, with smooth gradients that provide low scan loss coefficients and minimize sidelobes. The fundamental goal of this Phase I effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of combining discrete 3D-printed dielectric materials within a single lens to extend the permittivity range beyond what is possible with a single material, with index matching at the interfaces to produce smooth dielectric gradients throughout the entire structure. The lenses produced with this technique promise extremely large instantaneous bandwidth, conformal integration into air vehicles or other platforms, the potential for high power handling, and above all, low cost and rapid manufacturing. They support the implementation of a simple, high performance, reliable RF system to meet the needs of low-cost platforms across domains in the DoD."

Compact planar lenses generally require a high dielectric constant gradient, with the central lens portion having a relative dielectric constant around 10. In practice, the designer is often limited by the dielectric constants of standard AM materials, which generally hover around 3. In order to take advantage of the fabrication benefits of additive manufacturing, the ARS team proposes doping standard 3D printed materials with a SrTiO3 nano-powder to produce a printable material with a relative dielectric constant of up to 20. Strontium titanate has a loss tangent less than 0.003, so it will not notably increase ohmic losses. Critically, additive manufacturing with this doped material allows for a nearly-continuous dielectric constant gradient in all three spatial dimensions. This is in contrast to the typical stacked approach which often has minimal vertical spatial gradient or has discrete layers, which can prevent wideband impedance matching and increase sidelobes. The proposed system is volumetrically compact, lightweight, low-loss, able to be conformally mounted to an aircraft, and can achieve wide-angle scanning with reduced sidelobes relative to comparable approaches."

Removing water vapor from the air using a desiccant process separates the latent cooling (dehumidification) process from the sensible air cooling process, which has been demonstrated to reduce the energy cost of cooling. The use of an enthalpy wheel to transfer heat from warm indoor exhaust air to cool outdoor ventilation makeup air reduces the energy cost of heating makeup air while improving indoor air quality. Triton proposes to replace the chilled water coil currently used to dehumidify replenishment air with a desiccant wheel that uses an advanced adsorbent with water uptake capability that is 4-5 times higher than that of the commonly used silica gel and molecular sieve (zeolite) materials. This will permit a very compact system design. Another advantage of the proposed desiccant is that it is regenerated at significantly lower temperatures than common desiccant which improves energy efficiency. We will use an enthalpy wheel for winter air heating. Triton has been working with advanced adsorbents for several years and is developing manufacturing process technologies to increase batch production size and reduce cost. We will work with our partner to develop a ruggedized system design that interfaces with current and future Navy HVAC architecture. Our partner has decades of experience developing and supplying HVAC equipment for Navy surface combatants."

PSI proposes a Cooperative Optically Responsive MWIR Filter (CORE-MF) that simultaneously achieves requirements for fast autonomous actuation, rapid recovery time, and long-term endurance. CORE-MF consists of a COTS DMD where the window has been replaced by a custom MWIR-transmissive Intensity Dependent Infrared Attenuator (IDIRA) consisting of a vanadium oxide (VO2) coating on a MWIR-transmissive substrate. The CORE-MF acts as an in-line reflective filter in a larger imaging sensor. Targets with MWIR radiation below acceptable damage thresholds pass through the CORE-MF unchanged. As target radiance increases energy is absorbed locally, causing local heating of VO2, and reducing MWIR transmission only where heating occurs. A second-level of spatially-selective attenuation is provided by the DMD via fast binary half-toning for the brightest objects. The net result is a dual-stage cooperative optically-responsive MWIR filter capable of delivering >10,000x attenuation only where needed. During the Phase I program, IDIRA substrate and coating fabrication will be advanced, a concept for custom compact DMD controllers will be developed and a functional alpha CORE-MF prototype will be demonstrated."

However, a simple anomaly detection ML technique driven from observational data may be insufficient for tracking the performance of a system intended to produce arbitrary geometry. The methodology chosen for a defect monitoring system must be given information about the intent of the machine�s current activity (e.g. by being fed data from the CAM system in addition to process monitoring data) in order to sufficiently judge the state of the system. The key innovation proposed for this project is the ability to cleanly automate the entire specimen preparation and analysis process.� For the success of machine learning tasks, much attention must be paid to training a joint embedding of the different data types in latent space that adequately represent the combined feature space. As preliminary work, the team developed an AM state prediction deep learning (DL) model that was applied to AM anomaly detection. � With PINE�s Hybrid Additive Manufacturing Repair (HAMR) we can unify the specimen creation, data collection, and model training in one unified system. By using ML techniques, we can develop a real-time defect detection method that could inform AM engineers to intervene and prevent further defects from happening, reducing waste of time, energy and resources."

Unfortunately, transitioning riblets from machined aluminum panels to a format that can be utilized for large scale aerospace applications has been unsuccessful. Applique riblet films required significant application time and specialized workers. Utilizing photocurable coatings is a complex process that is beyond current industry capabilities. MTech believes there is an opportunity to leverage commercialized laser technology and apply it in a novel way to produce riblets directly into an already coated and cured surface utilizing direct laser interference patterning (DLIP). This technology would enable an economically feasible large-scale production of riblets on the range of 50-100 microns by a contact/wear-free continuous process. MTech has adopted specific technical objectives that define the research required to verify the geometric detail and resulting chemical composition of DLIP applied riblets. MTech will research and demonstrate the micro scale geometry capabilities of the DLIP process on a standard cured MIL-PRF-85285 Type IV topcoat. The MIL-PRF-85285 coating containing the riblets will tested for conformance with the specification requirements to include, but not limited to, the following: gloss, tape resistance, adhesion, heat resistance, color, fluid resistance, solvent resistance, cleanability, weather resistance, and impact flexibility. These tests will confirm the durability of the riblets in the uniquely harsh operational environment that Naval aircraft experience. The impacts of riblets on routine maintenance will be invested and the maintenance level of any maintenance tasks will be determined. A detailed BCA will be conducted highlighting the benefits of riblet production via DLIP versus projected reduction in fuel consumption. These key objectives will demonstrate the necessary technological maturity of the DLIP process to move rapidly to a commercialized application of both military and commercial aircraft."

It has been demonstrated that fiber-optic gyroscopes (FOGs) can be pushed to their limits when housed in a fixed environment.��To transmit an optical signal into such a housing, the bulkhead connector must additionally provide a hermetic seal to prevent atmospheric exchange.��Traditionally this is accomplished by sealing a small section of similar fiber within the connector for each fiber to contact while blocking the flow of atmosphere, potentially extending the connector length and certainly doubling the minimum achievable coupling losses and polarization perturbations from the connection misalignments due to double the optical connections being made. FOGs are being integrated into ever more systems that engineers struggle to continually reduce in size.��In order to recover every available centimeter, it is critical to reduce the size of the hermetic pass-through connectors.��Naval interest implies long term exposure to salt and humidity, which can highly accelerate corrosion of many materials and material interfaces.��Use on FOG implies motion through varying environments, so pressure variations as well as shock and vibe performance will be important while in energized and de-energized states.� RAM Photonics stands as a uniquely positioned SBIR performer, combining mechanical and optical expertise along with our latest technology, the FusionForge.��The FusionForge is a platform for automated reel to weld optical fiber processing system that can draw fiber from a reel, strip it, clean it, inspect it, align it to a glass microlens while maintaining polarization, and laser weld it in place to create a monolithic system.��This monolithic system is ideal for generating high stability expanded beam coupling. Additionally, this system is designed for close packing of aligned and welded fibers down to 300 �m spacing, putting the results of this SBIR either well on the way toward automated mass manufacturing or in position to provide a 6-in-1 compact arrayed fiber connector.�???????"

In recent years, robots have begun to undertake this task, but have not been fully successful due to being severely limited in endurance, maneuverability, and communications capability. GreenSight, a leading manufacturer of aerial and marine robots, is excited to introduce CASSEE, a Compact Aerial System for Shipboard Enclosed Environments. It is a uniquely-featured long endurance (~1hr) confined space inspection drone system for ships, designed to fit into, through, and around the interior confined spaces of ships, yet be robust and powerful enough to be used to inspect exterior structures as well. CASSEE's main advantage over competitors is its long flight time, enabled by its optimized bicopter propulsion concept: dual, wide-diameter rotors fill the available rectangular 14x24"" space and allow for minimal disc loading and maximum efficiency.� The fully enclosed composite monocoque body provides a robust structure capable of surviving the inevitable bumps and scrapes when flying in confined spaces, while also serving as a propeller guard and a waterproof and dustproof enclosure for electronics components. CASSEE's chassis surround will be covered with widefield cameras, illuminated by powerful LEDs.� CASSEE's user interface will leverage these cameras to provide operator� awareness in a complete 360 degree sphere regardless of the orientation of the drone. For detailed inspection requiring high magnification, CASSEE will have a removable three-axis optical zoom camera gimbal that can be attached either on the top or bottom of the drone, and swapped out with other cameras or environmental sensor systems to enable future inspections. In advanced iterations, onboard image processing will use the 360 degree cameras for autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, and mapping. CASSEE�s avionics are built around GreenSight's fully NDAA compliant UltraBlue robotic controller suite, and will feature a secure, encrypted mesh datalink. CASSEE will be a game changer for the Navy's ship inspection capabilities, and GreenSight is fully capable of making it a reality."

The ability of a low energy exploding foil initiator (LEEFI or EFI) to function in the SSP D5 missile system is to be investigated and demonstrated. Specifically, since the missile is subject to various strategic radiation environment environments; any electrical system must be robust enough to reliably operate during exposure to the elevated radiation environment. Many EFI designs exist in industry and their viability must be understood prior to use in systems which experience radiation environments. To provide potential users with a wider selection for their application and to promote new designs, characterization of the performance of bridge foils of varying materials and sizes will be conducted when subjected to various radiation environments, comprised of neutrons, gammas, X-rays, electrons, and Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP). The baseline application is for EFIs, which conform to MIL-STD-1316 and/or MIL-STD-1901, design and safety requirements for use in systems. Of particular interest is the effects of radiation on the narrowed bridge area (metal, e.g., aluminum, copper, gold, silver) and flyer (dielectric, e.g., polyimide, polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) aspects of the bridge foil such that the EFI would not fire or would prematurely fire. The Phase I deliverables would include an analysis-based �handbook� and recommended processes to evaluate typical common EFI bridge foil and flyer materials and how they react in various radiation environments for determining EFI viability in a system and/or narrow down design parameters for a custom EFI in a strategic system. Phase I Option would expand upon Phase I Base by conducting initial design specifications based on the Phase I Analysis-Based handbook and Phase I Final Report. The innovative approach we employ in our project is the coupling of experimental and simulations to provide predictive capabilities and to validate test results. Our proposed �optimal� integration of simulations and testing in the way of simulation leading testing and testing supporting simulation not only allows for validation, verification, and a predictive tool, but also enables true understanding of radiation interaction physics and, as a result, new design and material development. We will use a variety of radiation test facilities available at UU and LMTF, along with electrical testing facilities at InnoSys using different EFI materials/designs. It is worth noting that the combined capabilities of this team are also very unique and form an ideal platform for this proposed study to �enhance"" the radiation capability of EFI through detailed study, understanding, and development."

Coating MEMS devices with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) that are conductive along the length of the molecule, but insulative laterally across the device will mitigate both mechanisms, and lead to MEMS devices as a viable option for strategic sensors. Lynntech is developing a coating system to selectively vapor deposit SAMs on silicon and not oxides or metals, which will make our system applicable to incorporation at any point in the MEMS devices fabrication process.

The production of air vehicles must rapidly increase in order to prepare for a war of attrition and increase the United States� air superiority. As the desire for rapid development and production of composite air vehicles increases, the need for faster fabrication processes becomes more important. One of the more time-consuming elements of the aircraft fabrication process is the assembly of all the complex components required to create the air vehicle shape and structure. Typical aircraft assembly processes include individual skin and internal structure pieces that are mechanically fastened together or, in some cases, bonded together. The process for creating the provisions for fastening (typically hole drilling) and bonding, as well as the process for holding the pieces in the correct locations during assembly (use of assembly jigs), requires significant time and capital expense. In addition, these processes require inspection steps to ensure they were performed correctly. Ultimately, these labor- and capital-intensive processes increase the lead-time and cost of assembled aircraft structures. An alternate approach to reduce or eliminate these steps is desired to achieve goals of more rapid air vehicle development and production. Compression molding is a rapid composite forming process that forms and cures in minutes rather than hours, allows for a wide range of shapes and thickness, and allows for objects such as metal bosses to be imbedded into parts during forming. Typically used for compression molding is sheet molding compound (SMC), which is widely available in carbon and fiberglass options. This technology is proven to produce low-cost parts, with production part cost of under $200 per pound, not including NRE and tooling. This high-rate manufacturing process consists of rapidly cutting the SMC with a ply cutter, loading the material into the mold, closing the press and keeping it closed for 2 to 10 minutes, then removing the formed part from the mold to cool."

Cu-based shape memory alloys (SMA) have the potential to meet Navy�s requirements. An SMA undergoes diffusion-less solid-state phase transformation, accompanied by a latent heat as a result of the first order structural change. Upon heating up from its low temperature phase, a SMA will absorb heat before it completes the solid-state transformation. A SMA capable of absorbing 1.4 J/g heat at 30 K will meet Navy�s need. It can be machined into linear plates and installed into cryogenic refrigeration systems for high-temperature superconductor equipment. However, at cryogenic temperatures (30-77 K), most SMAs stop �working�: they lose all their ability to transform because the small thermal energy fluctuation at cryogenic temperature is not enough to overcome the energy barrier between the solid phases. Cu-Al-Zn, Cu-Al-Mn, and Cu-Al-Ni are three exceptions. Although none of their presently known latent heat values can meet Navy�s targets, they are not too far off from the requirement. Here, we propose a concerted machine learning guided materials development effort to search around the known Cu-Al-based SMAs with the goal of discovering novel compositions of Cu-SMAs with latent heat 1.4 J/g at 30-77 K. Our machine learning algorithm is based on Bayesian active learning, which has proven to be effective in dramatically reducing the overall number of necessary experiments. Combinatorial arc melting methods will be used to prepare the samples with compositions prescribed by the algorithm. Physical Properties Measurement System will be used to characterize thermal properties of the prepared samples. We expect 10 iterations will be more than enough to converge on the final compositions which satisfy the requirement. Candidate alloys will be studied for manufacturability and feasibility of cryogenic applications. A 5 kg plate will be fabricated and tested as the final deliverable of the project.�???????"

As mission complexity increases due to the increased dimensionality of data collection and new, more capable actors, the additional information gathered does not make that information less impoverished or well-planned actions more resilient. TTPs must now adapt to dynamic conditions. Moreover, with mission complexity challenging operator workload, more incentive exists to offload operators of their real-time analysis, assessment, planning, and deployment tasks, to reduce errors and achieve mission objectives expeditiously. Aptima proposes to address these challenges with artificial intelligence capable of developing domain awareness and synthesizing TTPs aligned with mission objectives.

The response time of the filter is in picosecond range, and the recovery time is equally fast. The increase in size, weight and power consumption (SWaP) of the imaging system is minimal.

Due to the precise nature of the systems that utilize EFI's, it is critical that they operate with no degradation in performance when exposed to elevated radiation environments prior to actuation. Additionally, as EFI's find increasing use in future munition systems, it is necessary to better understand how they perform when subjected to various radiation environments, including neutrons, gammas, X-rays, electrons, and High Power Mircrowave(HPM)/Electro Magnetic Pulse (EMP). To address this need, Integrated Solutions for Systems (IS4S) proposes developing a Functional Assurance Certification Process (FACP) to characterize EFI bridge foil parameters and their effect on performance in these harsh environments. The FACP would allow for determining pass/fail criteria across a wider selection of new EFI designs and provide a standard characterization process for the performance of bridge foils of varying materials, sizes, shapes, composition, fabrication techniques, and performance. IS4S is uniquely qualified to support this effort with an unmatched team of Subject Matter Experts (SME's), past performance, and equipment not typical of a small business to support the successful execution of this program. IS4S SME's have examined the effects of radiation on a wide range of solid-state electronics, conducted sophisticated radiation transport modeling using GEANT4, and designed, constructed, and tested multiple high-performance EFI Firesets for the precise characterization of EFI flyer performance. Additionally, IS4S has a world-class High-Power Microwave (HPM) team with an EMP susceptibility capability in-house that can be leveraged in later phases of the proposed program to support testing of EFI and associated electronics against those threats. IS4S is also refurbishing and installing a Nuclear Weapons Effects simulator (NWES) Pulserad Model Generator that was recently decommissioned from the Navy postgraduate school, which would be ideal for benchmarking transport models of representative coupons of EFI bridge sections. The Pulserad 112A is a gamma simulator that employs Blumlein technology capable of a radiation exposure area of 2� x 2� at a 1000 Rads. These resources represent a significant core competency that will be necessary to develop an FACP and support IS4S's unique ability to execute the program proposed herein. Ultimately, the proposed FACP will provide potential users with a broader understanding of how EFI's degrade when subjected to harsh radiation environments and enable the development of more reliable and effective EFI's for use in a wide range of weapon systems across the Department of Defense."

FPGA devices can provide significant design flexibility, performance, and reconfigurability. However, these devices do not currently meet the goals for strategic systems assurance, which limits their use in these applications. These systems operate in environments where radiation effects must be both minimized and mitigated. Assurances are needed that these systems can recover from various single event effects and cumulative effects induced by radiation sources as well as ensure that the designs as implemented do not contain bugs or Trojans. GrammaTech is proposing to leverage its existing FPGA silicon and FPGA design analysis technologies to both detect vulnerability in FPGAs as well as to monitor, and mitigate radiation effects in an innovative new way, while also involving traditional approaches. By research the new approach and developing automation tools we will develop FPGA architecture changes that could be incorporated into future FPGA architectures to build in these assurances. This research will augment our exiting FPGA assurance tools with the capabilities to automatically monitor and mitigate for radiation applications. Subsequent research would involve support the developed technology natively with the FPGA silicon design."

The application is to maintain cryogenic temperatures on superconducting DC power cables in the event that cooling is interrupted. Most materials lose their specific heat capacity at low cryogenic temperatures and have poor heat storage capability. Materials that undergo a phase change involving latent heat offer a better heat storage option than materials that use sensible heat storage. Nitrogen, in a solid-to-liquid phase change, is sometimes used, but nitrogen is a gas at temperatures above 77 Kelvin, which adds to system complexity. Nitrogen gas also presents an asphyxiation risk when released in a confined space, making it undesirable on a Navy ship. Nickel-titanium, or Nitinol, alloys experience a solid-solid phase change behavior with the transition temperature dictated by the ratio of nickel and titanium and by the presence of other alloying elements. Nitinol alloys have demonstrated martensitic-to-austenitic phase change behavior at temperatures lower than 77 Kelvin. Triton proposes to develop a Nitinol alloy with martensitic-to-austenitic phase change at 30 K. The latent heat of phase change for Nitinol alloys varies from about 4 kJ/kg to about 35 kJ/kg with many alloys around 15 kJ/kg. Nitinol with the typical latent heat characteristic can manage 100 W of thermal load for 4 hours with about 100 kg of material. A material sample will be created and demonstrated in Phase I to confirm the phase change temperature and the latent heat of phase change. In Phase II we will demonstrate a product format to provide continuous thermal energy storage along the length of a superconducting DC power cable."

Such a coating is critical to the reliability of advanced Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) devices that malfunction if their micro-sized features become stuck. Stiction can occur from opposing surfaces being charged, which is particularly concerning in a nuclear environment. Stiction also occurs from the capillary action of narrow gaps holding up moisture encountered during aqueous microfabrication steps or high-humidity environments. The requirements for strategic sensors necessitate special considerations, including minimizing induced stresses from mismatches of coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), designing the sensor to be robust through strategic radiation environments, preventing parasitic charges from creating erroneous signals, and ensuring that the sensor will be stable over several decades. Other requirements will include robustness of the coating to each of the microfabrication steps subsequent to the SAM formation that might include deep etches or other methods of surface selectivity.� In Phase I, Triton plans to demonstrate a conformal coating for the wafer-level processing of MEMS devices that functions as an anistropically conductive anti-stiction monolayer. Performance will be demonstrated on test devices. The microfabricated monolayer-scale coating has a target resistance between the coating and the silicon substrate of < 100 Ohm and a lateral resistance of > 1 MOhm. The proposed process will allow for functionalization of only silicon and not oxide or metal surfaces while avoiding aqueous steps that cause stiction. The coating must be stable over 30 years in a storage environment. In the Phase I Option period, Triton plans to validate the coating performance on sample MEMS devices and to specify the optimized process design for Phase II transfer and prototyping of the technology at Triton. In Phase II, Triton plans to demonstrate the process for functionalizing MEMS devices with the anisotropically conductive, anti-stiction coating on a batch of at least five wafers. Characterization of the coating will include uniformity of coverage over typical MEMS features, coating selectivity, conductivity, stiction reduction, and thermal sensitivity for sample MEMS devices.

This proposal seeks to build a digital system to mix passive RF with the acquisition of such signals through commercially available software defined radio system that will feed into a pre-existing IR image processing core. The hardware capabilities will handle the real-time digitization and processing of both signals with edge computational abilities to make an intelligent system that can discern the detection and tracking of a target in a multimode passive IR/RF system."

Everyone in the defense realm is seeking low-cost drone aircraft for limited mission sets due to soaring costs for frontline military aircraft.� One issue with having many attritable aircraft is that they are still relatively large and take up precious space when not being used. This idleness is often the case due to their limited mission set. This may not be an efficient use secure storage, particularly in forward operations. We believe that a solution is the use of a multifunctional, flat-pack aircraft. These relatively small volume flat packs may be shipped to forward storage areas, bivouac impromptu airfields, or stored in seaborn containers. When needed, they can be assembled very rapidly to form an overwhelming quantity of low-cost drone aircraft. A new type of 3D printing, Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM), allows for multiple types of elements to be printed under thin aluminum aircraft skins. By combining several subsystems into a few flat panels, we can build an inexpensive, light weight, high performance aircraft that can be shipped, stored, and then assembled with limited semi-skilled manual labor. The goal of this program is to demonstrate the use of UAM printing to make multifunctional, flat aircraft components. These aircraft can be rapidly assembled in large quantities to launch an overwhelming attack against targets or saturate an air defense system. 3D printing via UAM is scalable from the micro-UAV (Class 1) to medium altitude long endurance (Class 4) vehicles and can produce subsystems for larger vehicles. The main objective of this Phase I project is to develop a new concept for airborne drone manufacture and deployment. While we have an aircraft configuration that is well suited for UAM flat pack manufacturing and delivery, we also need to meet with defense personnel to discuss possible applications and targeted development. The team will enhance the technology consideration by creating a more detailed design and a coupon demonstrating integrated components for a proof-of-concept. Specifically, the team will: Meet with the customer and stakeholders to discuss specific needs and objectives. Rough design an aircraft to meet customers� needs. Refine and begin to detail flat pack design specs using stakeholder needs and the capabilities of the UAM process. This analysis will seek to effectively answer the following questions: How to optimize the design by combining multiple UAM features in a single panel? What commercial off the shelf (COTS) components can be utilized? What does the customer specifically need that this aircraft can fulfill? With this configuration, what is the approximate assembly time and cost of the aircraft? Create an item to demonstrate that the UAM process can accomplish the design goals."

The prospect of discontinuous SiC fiber yarns can lead to improved drapability, processing, and tunable thermal properties for a wide range of domestically produced CMCs. It is the goal of this Phase I program to develop a melt extrudable SiC-acrylonitrile system to produce C/SiC fibers.

Manipulating the rheology of the copolymer with melt-modifiers will allow NanoSonic to tune the viscosity to meet parameters of screw-based extrusion. In addition, NanoSonic will incorporate SiC discontinuous fibers at high loadings into the copolymer system that will permit the transfer of the SiC properties to the C/SiC fiber once carbonized.

The work will advance the state-of-the-art in SAM fabrication by improving coating uniformity, providing conformal coverage of micron structures, and expanding the SAM molecule selection range, all of which lead to better MEMS stability, reliability, and functionality. �It will also meet the navy requirements by delivering a robust anti-stiction SAM coating with high electrical conductivity along the molecule chain while being non-conductive between molecules (1MOhm resistance across the coating). However, achieving these binary characteristics is challenging because high electrical conductivity along the linear (hydrophobic) molecular chain can increase cross-molecule conduction. Therefore, we are proposing an advanced SAM fabrication process that combines traditional SAM fabrication with additional steps that provide better control of the monolayer self-assembly process, thereby allowing us to precisely engineer the monolayer structure at the molecular level. We developed and implemented similar SAM technologies in prior work and found them to produce repeatable, uniform, high quality coatings. The process will also be cost-effective and scalable for mass production. � Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication has experienced rapid growth in the past decade due to its versatility and breadth of applications. However, one of the factors limiting its widespread use and reliability is the problem of stiction that may occur during fabrication and detrimentally affect MEMS operations. Stiction arises at the molecular level due to surface forces such as capillary action, hydrogen bonding, electrostatics, and van der Waals effects, which can dominate interactions at the micro-scale. Recently, applications using sub-nanometer SAM films have attracted attention in tackling stiction problems because of their high hydrophobicity, low surface energy, and compact packing structures that can inhibit capillary forces. These applications also provide coatings that exhibit low adhesion and friction, minimal energy loss, conformal coverage, and increased stability within a wide range of environmental conditions."

In addition, conventional methods of processing composite components are costly. Temper Inc. (Temper) proposes apply its smart susceptor technology to solve this problem. The technology has been developed specifically for the fabrication of components and assembling in high volume aerospace production. Applications of the Smart Susceptor technology include co-bonding and co-curing for traditional thermoset composites and co-consolidation and welding for thermoplastic composites. In addition, Temper will be focusing on certifying these manufacturing processes to aircraft standards and develop performance standards comparing the Smart Susceptor approach to traditional fabrication methods by generating test data for incorporation into FEA and design modeling software. Assemblies are comprised of individual parts, that are assembled. Temper seeks to incorporate four different fabrication methods that would be used in unison or piecemeal, in producing a structural assembly 15 ft x 6 ft x 6 ft with the goal in mind of a final assembly size of 40 ft x 6 ft x 6 ft. Those fabrication methods are a small part component fabrication method, a large part component fabrication method, a co-consolidation method and a welding method."

Trimer�s low-cost resin can cure in as little as 30 seconds at 250� F while achieving a glass transition temperature greater than 700� F and mechanical properties that rival the highest performance aerospace resins.� Furthermore, the resin has a low viscosity making it ideally suited for infusion of aerostructures.� This resin provides Trimer with the unique opportunity to developed high-rate production techniques for the development of airframes with reduced manufacturing and lifecycle costs.� In the Phase I research effort, Trimer will work with Boeing to develop the processing technology required for the manufacture of large airframe structures.� Trimer proposed to implement a latent resin system which can be infused into hot tooling with sufficiently long gel time at temperature followed by a snap cure such that very large structures can be infused yet rapidly cured.� The Phase I effort will focus on the analysis of strength, durability and the reduction of microcracking that can accompany low cycle time composites.� This SBIR will provide a new set of materials that provide manufacturing approaches which can reduce cycle time and lifecycle cost of composite airframes."

A node will represent a platform and each node will have a CRYSTALS-Dilithium public-private key pair that will be used when signing and validating certificates, in addition to message key encryption. This solution will also make use of two blockchains, one for certificate authentication and removal and another for messages in order to assist with identification and to ensure immutability. At a high level, all nodes are assigned a certificate from a higher-level authority and added onto the verification blockchain for the awareness of all members. When new nodes wish to join the network, a verification procedure utilizing a zero knowledge proof (ZKP) is run to confirm identity and open a communication channel securely. Once both nodes are authenticated, normal communications can resume using a double encryption technique. Once the connection is established, the transmission can be added to the message blockchain to ensure immutability via a consensus verification procedure. Thus, SEAPLANE is a permissionless, immutable, and decentralized protocol to authenticate users and establish communication channels securely."

The use of tag lines is inherently dangerous as they require people to be near the location of a moving load, in often hazardous settings. The fundamental problem of suspended load control exists for both crane and aircraft lifting operations.� The issues from lack-of suspended load control are magnified for at-sea operations, including ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore, at-sea replenishment, as well as aircraft-based vertical replenishment (VERTREP) missions. During these operations, suspended loads are subjected to often unpredictable, quasi-chaotic motion due to numerous factors, including environmental conditions such as sea state and high winds. Load characteristics such as drag characteristics, center of pressure, and the load's mass moment of inertia also influence the suspended load�s dynamic motion. The culmination of these varying disturbances and load characteristics often makes suspended load control via traditional manned-powered methods, such as an attempted control via taglines, a cumbersome challenge, even in a controlled environment.� Vita Inclinata Technologies, Inc, (�VitaTech�) has studied the complex problem of multi-degree of freedom (DOF) suspended load control for both aircraft and cranes for nearly a decade and has existing dual-use (military and commercial) products that provide on-demand, platform agnostic, autonomous load stabilization for crane and helicopter lifting applications. The solution developed by Vita is the autonomous Load Stability System (LSS) platform; a patented, novel autonomous load control system that: Is platform agnostic in design. I.e., no aircraft nor crane integration is necessary to perform precision load control at the push-of-a-button. Senses the environment, interprets data, and�determines an optimal set of correction criteria, then controls a load�s motion or position via actuation of high-performance electric propulsion units. Is scalable in configuration to meet a wide range of applications; from low-weight rescue stabilization to over 40 metric tons for crane, or aircraft, cargo stabilization. Under the scope of the Phase I effort, VitaTech will: Develop, and deliver results from, a model-based simulation study for an autonomous cargo stabilization system in a shipboard environment. Demonstrate the ability of Vita�s Load Stabilization System platform to meet, or exceed, the performance objectives for the Navy�s Autonomous Cargo Stabilization System at a TRL 6-7. Demonstrating both through observation, as well as quantified results, the precision, accuracy, and adaptability of Vita�s Load Stability Systems. NOTE: In the Technical Volume (Volume 2), VitaTech proposes an accelerated schedule to perform both the Phase I, and Phase I OPTION within a 6-month timeframe.

Our objective is to develop the capability for the observation of projectile trajectories, with a desired degree of visibility (DOV). Therefore, correction to trajectories may be made immediately upon firing via direct observation of trace, thereby significantly increasing the warfighters effectiveness on the battlefield. The MCSC Technical Points of Contact (TPOCs) have identified the 40mm ammunition types with the greatest need for luminescent capability as the MK281 training-practice (T-P, all variants/MODs) and M430A1 high explosive dual purpose (HEDP) high velocity (HV) variants. Incendiary tracer ammunition is the standard solution to observe trajectories. This capability has inherent downsides. From a warfighting perspective, DOV is such that it risks revealing the gunner�s position and from a safety & training perspective, it is the leading cause of range fires. The United States Army (USA) has explored a range of various tracer technologies that have been designated as �One Way Luminescent� (OWL). Strictly defined, luminescence is cold light where heat is not involved. Contrary to this designation, some USA OWL technologies are non-luminescent and are in fact incendiary. Additionally, some the previously tested OWL technologies have been found to degrade during storage, resulting in diminished visibility. Novel luminescent tracer solutions are needed to improve the warfighter�s capability. The founders of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (UL Lafayette) startup company, GlowSens, LLC have been involved in the research and development of luminescent tracer ammunition since 2005. GlowSens was formed in 2022 to support the commercialization of luminescent technologies. This combined GlowSens-UL Lafayette team is able to leverage the University�s experience, expertise and capabilities in the development of novel luminescent technologies. To date, the GS Team has tested more than 250 different luminescent materials and produced, fired, and observed many thousands of rounds of luminescent tracer ammunition. GlowSens founders are the original inventors of luminescent tracer ammunition (USPTO #8,402,896, Hybrid-Luminescent Munition Projectiles). This technology transfer represents the only commercially available luminescent tracer ammunition; offered by small arms ammunition manufacturer Ammo, Incorporated (ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/streak-ammunition/) as Streak �. We have secured letters of support from manufacturers which ensures timely commercial availability of luminescent tracer technology optimized for 40mm ammunition. MCSC will be able to rapidly integrate this technology into the supply chain once SBIR requirements have been met."
